FpML (Financial products Markup Language) is a business information exchange
standard based on Extensible Markup Language (XML) that enables
business-to-business over-the-counter (OTC) financial derivative transactions
online by following W3C standards.[1]

The standard is managed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association
(ISDA) on behalf of a community of investment banks that make up the OTC
derivatives industry.[2][3] All categories of privately negotiated derivatives
will eventually be included within the standard.

FpML is distinct from similar financial standards such as SWIFT and FIX because
it does not specify a network or transport mechanism.
