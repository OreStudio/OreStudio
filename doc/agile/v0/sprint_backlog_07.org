*** COMPLETED Consider compressing payload                             :code:
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2025-12-15 Mon 11:29]--[2025-12-15 Mon 13:32] =>  2:03
    CLOCK: [2025-12-15 Mon 09:58]--[2025-12-15 Mon 11:00] =>  1:02
    :END:

Sounds quite simple to extend the binary protocol with a compressed payload. We
just need some information in the header about it. We should support both
compressed and uncompressed payloads. Play with compression algos in boost.

*** COMPLETED Add lock account request                                 :code:
>>>>>>> 37dd037 ([agile] Backlog refinement)

*Rationale*: implemented last sprint.

As per gemini's comments, we should have a request to lock an account.

Notes:

- account unlock should return boolean rather than throw.

Test.

#+begin_src c++
TEST_CASE("handle_login_request_locked_account", tags) {
    auto lg(make_logger(test_suite));
    database_helper h;
    h.truncate_table(database_table);

    accounts_message_handler handler(h.get_context());
    boost::asio::io_context io_context;

    const auto account = generate_synthetic_account();
    create_account_request create_req(to_create_account_request(account));
    BOOST_LOG_SEV(lg, info) << "Create account request: " << create_req;

    const auto create_payload = create_req.serialize();
    run_co_test(io_context, [&]() -> boost::asio::awaitable<void> {
        auto result = co_await handler.handle_message(
            message_type::create_account_request,
            create_payload, "127.0.0.1:12345");
        REQUIRE(result.has_value());
    });

    // 2. Simulate locking the account (A dedicated lock request should exist,
    //    but for this test, we'll assume the handler has a method/logic for it
    //    or that the system supports a lock request message type).
    // Assuming a lock_account_request exists or the account is locked internally.
    unlock_account_request lock_req; // Re-use struct for simplicity, assuming a dedicated lock is handled internally
    lock_req.account_id = create_account_response::deserialize(
        handler.get_account_id_by_username(create_req.username)).value().account_id; // Hypothetical internal method
    // In a real system, you'd send a dedicated lock message here.
    // For now, we rely on a separate mechanism to put the account into a locked state.
    // **NOTE**: For a proper test, a dedicated LOCK_ACCOUNT_REQUEST is needed.

    // 3. Attempt login with valid credentials for the now-locked account
    login_request login_req;
    login_req.username = create_req.username;
    login_req.password = create_req.password;
    BOOST_LOG_SEV(lg, info) << "Attempting login for locked user: " << login_req.username;

    const auto login_payload = login_req.serialize();

    run_co_test(io_context, [&]() -> boost::asio::awaitable<void> {
        auto result = co_await handler.handle_message(
            message_type::login_request,
            login_payload, "192.168.1.100:54321");

        REQUIRE(result.has_value());
        const auto response_result = login_response::deserialize(result.value());
        REQUIRE(response_result.has_value());
        const auto& response = response_result.value();
        BOOST_LOG_SEV(lg, info) << "Response: " << response;

        CHECK(response.success == false);
        // Check for an explicit error message/code related to account lock.
        CHECK(response.error_message.find("locked") != std::string::npos);
    });
}
#+end_src




*** COMPLETED Add tests for messaging handler                          :code:

*Rationale*: implemented last sprint.

We need tests in comms which create a test request and response and a test
handler.
*** COMPLETED Add version support to entities                          :code:

*Rationale*: implemented last sprint.

We need a "version" field which is incremented automatically by a trigger. It is
used as follows:

- domain entities have a version field which is loaded from database.
- if we try to save at version =n= but current version is not =n-1=, it should
  fail to save.
- version is incremented automatically on save.
- display version in UI prominently (/e.g./ next to entity key, iso code for
  currencies) so that we can see when we reload.
*** COMPLETED Add skill to create new project component            2   :code:

*Rationale*: implemented last sprint.

Should create folders, CMakeLists, sample test, add to main make file etc. The
new project should compile.

*** COMPLETED Latest currencies should have different colour           :code:
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2025-12-15 Mon 22:41]--[2025-12-15 Mon 22:51] =>  0:10

    CLOCK: [2025-12-15 Mon 16:40]--[2025-12-15 Mon 16:49] =>  0:09
    :END:

After reloading we should mark latest currencies with a different colour so that
it is obvious what was added. Consider colouring rows by recency.

Notes:

- valid to is the same as valid from, which is incorrect.

*** COMPLETED Do not expose temporal machinery in domain               :code:
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2025-12-15 Mon 23:42]--[2025-12-16 Tue 00:07] =>  0:25

    CLOCK: [2025-12-15 Mon 21:40]--[2025-12-15 Mon 22:11] =>  0:31
    :END:

As per discussions with Claude:

#+begin_quote

That's a valid architectural concern. You're right that valid_from/valid_to are
temporal table implementation details that are leaking into the domain layer.

  Current state (leaky abstraction):
  - Domain entity has valid_from and valid_to strings
  - These are really repository/database concerns for temporal versioning (SCD Type 2 pattern)
  - The UI now displays these raw database fields

  Cleaner approach:
  - Domain entity has created_at (or modified_at) - represents when this version was created
  - Repository maps valid_from → created_at when loading
  - valid_to stays internal to repository (used for querying current vs historical records)
  - Domain doesn't need to know about the bi-temporal mechanics

  Benefits:
  - Domain entities are simpler and more intuitive
  - Repository encapsulates temporal implementation details
  - Easier to change temporal strategy without affecting domain
  - created_at is more meaningful to users than "valid from"

  I'll note this for future work. When you're ready to address it, the changes would involve:
  1. Rename valid_from → created_at in domain::currency
  2. Remove valid_to from domain (keep only in entity/repository layer)
  3. Update mapper to translate between them
  4. Update UI labels accordingly

*** COMPLETED Add account management support to qt                     :code:
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2025-12-16 Tue 09:54]--[2025-12-16 Tue 11:47] =>  1:53
    CLOCK: [2025-12-16 Tue 00:08]--[2025-12-16 Tue 01:58] =>  1:50
    :END:

At present we cannot add, remove etc accounts from the UI.

Notes:

- add history support for accounts.
- on delete we are automatically reloading.
- if a user has never logged in we should be able to see it. In fact we should
  bucket accounts by recency:
  - never logged in
  - logged in a long time ago
  - logged in recently
  - is logged in

*** COMPLETED Add password reset functionality to accounts             :code:
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2025-12-16 Tue 18:17]--[2025-12-16 Tue 18:55] =>  0:38
    CLOCK: [2025-12-16 Tue 17:05]--[2025-12-16 Tue 18:16] =>  1:11
    :END:

At present it is not possible to reset a user's password.

*** COMPLETED Add core infrastructure for roles and permissions        :code:
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2025-12-16 Tue 23:35]--[2025-12-17 Wed 00:08] =>  0:33
    CLOCK: [2025-12-16 Tue 22:04]--[2025-12-16 Tue 23:34] =>  1:30
    CLOCK: [2025-12-16 Tue 14:16]--[2025-12-16 Tue 16:30] =>  2:14
    CLOCK: [2025-12-16 Tue 11:48]--[2025-12-16 Tue 12:23] =>  0:35
    :END:

At present we are monitoring authorisation at two levels:

- is logged in
- is admin

We need to introduce basic RBAC where we have roles such as:

- Trading
- Sales
- Operations: restricted access to some trading screens.
- Support: read-only, admin screens.

To start off with we can map these to read/write on CRUD dialogs.

Notes:

- rename =flag_initializer= to =flag_seeder= to make it consistent. Done.

*** COMPLETED Add exit confirmation dialog                             :code:
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2025-12-17 Wed 00:33]--[2025-12-17 Wed 00:36] =>  0:03

#+begin_quote
This pull request executes a significant refactoring effort by renaming the
'accounts' module to 'IAM' (Identity and Access Management). This change
clarifies the module's responsibilities, which extend beyond simple account
management to encompass broader identity and access control functionalities. The
renaming impacts various aspects of the project, ensuring consistency in naming
conventions across the entire codebase, from file structures and build systems
to C++ namespaces and user-facing documentation.

Highlights:

- Module Renaming: The ores.accounts module has been comprehensively renamed to
  ores.iam to more accurately reflect its purpose as an Identity and Access
  Management component.
- Codebase-Wide Refactoring: This change involved updating directory names, C++
  namespaces (ores::accounts to ores::iam), include paths, and references across
  all relevant files, including source code, headers, build configurations
  (CMakeLists.txt), and documentation.
- Documentation and Diagram Updates: All internal and external documentation,
  including CLAUDE.md, ores.hpp, Org-mode files (.org), and PlantUML diagrams
  (.puml), have been updated to reflect the new ores.iam naming convention and
  its expanded description.

We need some kind of observability context so that we can look at related log
entries. This is sort of related to logging by thread except with coroutines we
are no longer interested in threads per se but on some kind of "work identifier"
which is preserved across function calls. For this we can have an observability
context which is passed around.

Gemini summary;

#+begin_quote
This pull request integrates a new ores.telemetry component, establishing a
robust framework for observability within the project. By adhering to the
OpenTelemetry standard, it facilitates distributed tracing and log correlation,
crucial for understanding complex system behavior. The design prioritizes
coroutine-safety through explicit context management, ensuring that telemetry
data can be accurately captured and propagated across asynchronous call chains.

Highlights:

- New Telemetry Component: Introduced a new ores.telemetry component, fully
  aligned with the OpenTelemetry specification, to enable distributed tracing
  and log correlation across the system.
- Core Observability Domain Types: Defined essential domain types including
  trace_id, span_id, span_context, span, log_record, and resource, providing a
  structured foundation for telemetry data.
- Unique ID Generators: Implemented thread-safe trace_id_generator and
  span_id_generator classes that embed timestamps and machine IDs, ensuring
  uniqueness, time-sortability, and efficient generation of identifiers.
- Coroutine-Safe Context Propagation: Provided a telemetry_context class
  designed for explicit, immutable context passing, making it safe and effective
  for tracing within coroutine-based asynchronous operations.
- Comprehensive Testing and Modeling: Included extensive unit tests for ID
  generation, context propagation, and span lifecycle management, alongside
  PlantUML diagrams for clear visualization of the component's architecture.
#+end_quote

Notes:

- we should also add the notion of parents and children so that we can create a
  graph with the relationships. We should create specific messages for this
  which are not directly related to logging. The server can just keep track of
  the observability contexts in a table. We should link it back to each client
  etc.
- the observability context should also extend to the server so that we can
  filter all logs for that ID.
- consider using mongo IDs for this or create our own IDs:

#+begin_src c++
Option A: 64-bit IDs (8 bytes) - Best balance
cpp
struct LogId {
    uint32_t timestamp;  // seconds since 2020
    uint16_t machine;    // 0-65535 machines
    uint16_t sequence;   // per-second counter

    // Encode to 11 Base64 chars or 8-10 Base62 chars
};
#+end_src

Merged stories:

*Log with session id*

When we have a lot of clients all connecting we can't really see who is doing
what in the server. We need an additional "tag" in logging to represent the
session.

*** COMPLETED History should have a revert button                      :code:

It should be possible to choose a given version and ask the system to revert the
currency to that version. It just makes an update with a new version to look
like that version. It should also be possible to open at version. It shows the
edit dialog in "read only mode" with the entity at that version. The tool bar
should indicate this. It should also have a revert in that dialog.

*** COMPLETED History should have a reload button                      :code:

It should be possible to reload history without having to reload currencies. In
an ideal world we should be able to listen to currency specific notifications.
This will be needed in the future for other types of events.

This pull request undertakes a significant refactoring effort to enhance the
modularity and clarity of the codebase by splitting the monolithic ores.utility
module into more focused components. The primary goal is to separate
platform-specific functionalities into a dedicated ores.platform module, thereby
improving dependency management and making the architecture more maintainable
and extensible. This change ensures that core utilities remain lean, while
system-level interactions are encapsulated in their own distinct layer.

Highlights:

- New Module: ores.platform: Introduced a new C++ module, ores.platform,
  specifically designed to house platform-specific utilities and abstractions
  for OS and hardware interaction. This module includes functionalities for
  environment variables, filesystem operations, and network information.
- Refactoring of ores.utility: Key components such as environment variable
  handling, filesystem operations (file I/O, directory search), and network
  information (hostname, MAC address, process ID) have been extracted from
  ores.utility and moved into the new ores.platform module. The ores.utility
  module has been updated to reflect these removals and now focuses on more
  general-purpose utilities like logging, UUID generation, string manipulation,
  DateTime, Converter (Base32/Base64), and program options.
- Dependency Updates: Build configurations (CMakeLists.txt) and PlantUML
  diagrams across various projects (ores.risk, ores.telemetry, ores.testing)
  have been updated to correctly reference the new ores.platform module where
  platform-specific functionalities are now located, ensuring proper linking and
  architectural representation.
- Codebase Migration: All existing code references to ores.utility::environment,
  ores.utility::filesystem, and ores.utility::net have been updated to point to
  their new locations within ores.platform::environment,
  ores.platform::filesystem, and ores.platform::net respectively, ensuring a
  seamless transition to the new modular structure.

**** Previous analysis

Gemini made an interesting review comment for

: projects/ores.accounts/include/ores.accounts/domain/account_role.hpp

#+begin_src c++
/**
 * @brief Timestamp when this role assignment was created.
 */
std::string assigned_at;
#+end_src

For consistency with other domain event objects and for better type safety,
consider using =std::chrono::system_clock::time_point= for assigned_at instead
of =std::string=. Storing timestamps as strings in domain objects can be
error-prone and makes date/time arithmetic difficult. The conversion from the
database string format can be handled in the mapper.

Suggested change:

#+begin_src diff
-std::string assigned_at;
+std::chrono::system_clock::time_point assigned_at;
#+end_src

Claude agrees:

Using =std::chrono::system_clock::time_point= is architecturally better for
several reasons:

Advantages:

- Type safety - Compiler catches errors; can't accidentally assign arbitrary
  strings
- Time arithmetic - Easy to compute durations, compare timestamps
- Idiomatic C++ - Standard library type for time handling
- Self-documenting - The type itself conveys "this is a point in time"

Trade-offs:

- Requires conversion code in mappers (string ↔ time_point)
- Need to handle timezone consistently (UTC recommended)
- Serialization to JSON/protocol buffers needs explicit handling

My recommendation: I agree with the reviewer's suggestion. The conversion
complexity is localized to mappers, and the benefits of type safety throughout
the rest of the codebase outweigh the cost.

However, this should be done consistently across all domain types (accounts,
roles, permissions, etc.), not just RBAC. Otherwise you'd have mixed patterns -
some types using strings, some using time_point.

Good candidate for a separate PR that:

- Adds timestamp conversion utilities to the mapper infrastructure
- Updates all domain types to use time_point
- Updates all mappers consistently

This keeps the RBAC PR focused and makes the timestamp improvement a coherent,
reviewable change.

This pull request significantly improves the robustness and testability of the
project. It addresses critical issues that could lead to test timeouts by
ensuring the reliable generation of unique synthetic data. Furthermore, it
resolves platform-specific build failures on macOS and expands the test suite
with dedicated unit tests for key generator components, contributing to a more
stable and well-tested codebase.

Highlights:

- Test Stability: Resolved potential infinite loops in unique synthetic data
  generation functions (e.g., for currency images, images, tags, and currencies)
  by implementing a suffix-based uniqueness mechanism when the faker library
  produces duplicate values.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Fixed macOS build errors related to
  std::chrono::system_clock::time_point construction by explicitly using
  std::chrono::duration_cast when converting from nanoseconds.
- Enhanced Test Coverage: Introduced new unit tests for tag, image, and
  currency_image generators to ensure their correct functionality, including
  single, multiple, and unique data generation scenarios.
- Standardized Testing Configuration: Centralized and updated Catch2 test
  arguments in the main CMakeLists.txt and individual project test
  CMakeLists.txt files for consistent reporting, specifically changing the XML
  reporter syntax.

Gemini PR summary:

#+begin_quote
This pull request introduces a foundational ores.assets component, establishing
a comprehensive system for managing dynamic assets within the application. It
provides structured domain models for images, tags, and their relationships,
backed by a bitemporal database design that supports versioning and historical
tracking. The new component includes a full data access layer with mappers and
repositories, complemented by synthetic data generators and extensive test
coverage to ensure its stability and functionality.

Highlights:

- New Component: ores.assets: Introduced a new component, ores.assets, dedicated
  to dynamic asset management, particularly for images and their associations.
- Domain Models: Added core domain models including image (for SVG content), tag
  (for categorization), image_tag (for many-to-many relationships), and
  currency_image (to link currencies with their flags).
- Bitemporal Database Support: Implemented robust bitemporal database tables
  (images, tags, image_tags, currency_images) with valid_from and valid_to
  timestamps, triggers for versioning, optimistic locking, and soft deletes,
  ensuring historical data integrity.
- Repository Layer: Developed a complete repository layer with mappers and
  repository classes for each domain model, facilitating CRUD operations and
  data persistence.
- Synthetic Data Generators and Tests: Included generators for synthetic data
  for all new domain models and comprehensive test suites for the repository
  classes, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the data access layer.
- SQL Schema and Utilities: Provided detailed SQL scripts for creating and
  dropping the new asset-related tables, along with a utility function
  (load_flag) to easily load SVG flag images into the database.

*Previous analysis*

Actually it is better to have a generic mechanism to upload an SVG and maybe tag
it with an identifier. Then we could have a way to associate a currency with one
of the available SVGs. The currency dialog could have a tab where users can
select the SVG from a list. We can then have a table with SVG for currency which
remembers these. This provides a generic solution for all cases where we have
some kind of asset and an associated image.

This pull request introduces a comprehensive user self-registration feature,
enabling new users to create accounts independently. It encompasses updates
across the backend messaging system, a new service layer for robust validation
and account creation, and a fully integrated user interface within the Qt
client. The functionality is controlled by system-level feature flags, ensuring
administrators can manage its availability and behavior.

Highlights:

- User Self-Registration (Signup) Workflow: Introduced a complete workflow for
  new user self-registration, allowing unauthenticated users to create accounts
  when enabled by a feature flag. This includes new messaging protocols, a
  dedicated service for handling signup logic, and a frontend UI in the Qt
  client.
- New Messaging Protocol and Handler: Added signup_request and signup_response
  messages to the accounts messaging protocol. The accounts_message_handler now
  includes a handle_signup_request method to process these messages, leveraging
  the new signup service.
- Dedicated Signup Service: A new signup_service has been implemented to
  encapsulate the business logic for user registration. This service performs
  crucial validations such as checking for enabled user signups, username and
  email uniqueness, and password policy compliance before creating new accounts.
- Qt Client Integration: The Qt client has been updated with a new SignUpDialog
  and a ClientManager::signup method. This provides a user-friendly interface
  for self-registration, including input validation and asynchronous
  communication with the backend.
- System Flags for Control: Enhanced system flags with user_signups to
  enable/disable the self-registration feature and signup_requires_authorization
  (though not yet implemented) to control whether new accounts need admin
  approval.
- Account Repository Enhancement: The account_repository now includes a
  read_latest_by_email method, essential for ensuring email address uniqueness
  during the signup process.
- Protocol Version Increment: The communication protocol minor version has been
  incremented to 13.1 to reflect the addition of new message types and error
  codes related to the signup workflow.

*** Implement RBAC enforcement                                         :code:

Conversation with Claude:

RBAC permission checking is not yet implemented. The handlers currently use
simple session->is_admin checks rather than checking permissions via the
authorization_service.

For example in =handle_lock_account_request:301:=

#+begin_src c++
  // Current: simple admin check
  if (!session->is_admin) { ... }

  // Should be: permission check
  if (!auth_service_.has_permission(session->account_id, permissions::accounts_lock)) { ... }
#+end_src

The RBAC infrastructure exists (permissions, roles seeded in DB), but it's not
being enforced. To properly test RBAC, we need to:

1. Inject authorization_service into accounts_message_handler
2. Replace is_admin checks with permission checks
3. Store permissions in session (optional, for performance)

Would you like me to implement proper RBAC enforcement in the message handlers?
This would involve:

- Adding authorization_service to the handler
- Checking specific permissions like accounts:lock, accounts:reset_password, etc.
- Non-admin users with the right role/permissions would then be allowed to perform those operations

> actually maybe we should split that into a separate PR as this one is already
> very large. I'll merge it as is

● Good call. The current PR already includes:

- RBAC domain types (permission, role, account_role, role_permission)
- Database schema for RBAC tables
- authorization_service for managing permissions/roles
- rbac_seeder for seeding predefined permissions and roles
- Protocol messages for RBAC operations (list_roles, list_permissions, assign_role, etc.)
- Protocol version bump to 13.0

The follow-up PR would implement:

- Injecting authorization_service into message handlers
- Replacing is_admin checks with proper permission checks
- Testing non-admin users with specific role permissions

This keeps the current PR focused on RBAC infrastructure and the next one on
enforcement.

Notes:

- add tests for all new entities. Code coverage has dropped a lot after adding
  them.

*** Add UI for roles and permission management                         :code:

We added the core infrastructure but we need a way to manage it from Qt and from
the shell.

*** Tests are logging to stdout in github                              :code:

There is a lot of stdout output in CDash. We need to understand why that is.

*** Add a dashboard for users                                          :code:

Examples:

[[./user_dashboard_core_ui.png]]

*** User interface options                                             :code:

This story keeps track of configuration points in the UI which should be added
at some point:

- display time in human readable form - e.g. last month, 3 months ago, etc.
- auto-reload. If a dialog receives new data, reload it automatically. Defaults
  to off.

Notes:

- we need a UI to manage the UI options.
- should be stored in the server and cached locally with a sqlite db.

*** New feature flags                                                  :code:

- allow sign-ups. If true, users can create their own accounts.
- auto-authorise sign-ups. If true, the account is automatically created. If
  false, admin user has to authorise it.

Notes:

- we need a UI to manage the UI options.

*** Assorted fixes to currency dialog                                  :code:

At present the following is not working or is a snag:

- can we make the details windows unmaximisable.
- currencies history is broken, does not show changes diff. Done.
- version is zero. Done.
- update the modified by and modified at in currencies to use recorded
  terminology.
- We need to either make the columns configurable, or remove some less useful
  columns such as symbol, fraction etc.
- save new currency does not close dialog.
- can we refactor reload logic into common entity code.

*** Assorted fixes to accounts dialog                                  :code:

- remove "grant administrative privileges" from details screen.
- old users remain online. Server should check sessions on start and update
  table.
- cannot tell who unlocked an account and when.
- do not use "old" for accounts who never logged in. Maybe "unused"?
- at present you can't tell if you asked for a password reset. We probably
  should use Status to mean: locked, unlocked, reset. And maybe "Age" or "Last
  Login" to mean: online, never, recent, old.
- add right-click menu with the context options from the toolbar.
- after reload, lock etc remember which line we were on and return to it.
- email updated message is truncated.
- user cannot lock it's own account.

*** Implement entity history in shell                                  :code:

We need to add a command in shell to show entity history.

Notes:

- for the history diff we could use a simple unified diff format.

*** Consider adding an "entity waterfall"                              :code:

It would be nice to be able to see what entities have been added, deleted,
modified, etc. This would work as a running commentary.

*** Notification of deletes                                            :code:

At present it is easy to see new rows or modified rows in an entity dialog. It
is not possible to see deleted rows. One way to do this is to preserve state
from before reload by key. Any entities which are not present after reload can
be shown as red. History then allows users to re-instate deleted entities.

*** Add REPL to Qt                                                     :code:

Users should be able to interact with the system directly via the REPL. Add a
simple widget for this.


*** Add entity messages should not set modified by                     :code:

At present you can supply any modified by you want in the protocol messages. It
makes more sense to say the message must have the modified by as the user logged
in from the session.

*** Add heat map of user sessions                                      :code:

Things to measure:

- duration of sessions (once we have session table).
- bytes sent/received per session (possibly 3-D plot?). Also good for anomaly
  detection.
- mine github for ideas.

*** Perform tests to check database connectivity                       :code:

We added some basic database monitoring but did not perform a lot of testing.

We should also generalise this so that if the database goes down after start we
still perform some kind of retry logic.

See also this point from Gemini:

#+begin_quote
The new broadcast_all method appears to be unused in this pull request. The
database status broadcast is implemented directly in
=ores::comms::net::server::broadcast_database_status= without using the
subscription_manager. If this method is not intended for future use, it could be
removed to avoid dead code.
#+end_quote

*** Add currencies update command to shell                             :code:

At present we can only add new currencies. We also need to be able to update.
Also, adding currencies requires supplying all parameters.

*** Add session information to database                                :code:

At present we register the last login etc. It would be nice to record every
session as well, including the duration.

Notes:

- record bytes sent/received.
- keep track of geolocation so we know where users are logging in from.
- calculate statistical measures (average session duration, average bytes etc)
  and consider plotting them. Also in the aggregate so we can see patterns over
  time.
- keep track of the session id so we know what client we are using, the version
  etc. We should display this information in the accounts dialog.
- on the main accounts dialog we should show the number of open sessions.

*** Subscribe on reconnect fails                                       :code:

We should probably unsubscribe before we logout.

*** Use events in comms and accounts                                   :code:

- connect, disconnect, retry
- login, logout

*** Data in login info looks spurious                                  :code:

#+end_src

Also, we need a login timestamp and a logout timestamp so we can measure session
duration.

*** Currencies displays when not connected                             :code:

At present we can display currencies even before we connect. This is probably ok
but we should at least state we are not connected. Alternatively it should be
disabled.

*** =ores.qt= is not using client session                              :code:

Refactor client manager to use it.

*** Add sound assets                                                   :code:

We need to be able to associate sounds to certain events such as disconnect,
connect etc. Users need to be able to choose their own sounds.

*** Add a delete all button which deletes all currencies               :code:

It is useful especially in test environments to be able to delete all entities
before a re-import.

Notes:

- purge button.


*** Add screen in qt to exit bootstrap mode                            :code:

As per claude:

The create_initial_admin_request message type serves several important purposes
that differentiate it from the CLI and REPL approaches:

Why We Need create_initial_admin_request

  1. Network-accessible bootstrap flow
  - Allows remote initial setup from localhost without requiring shell/CLI access
  to the server
  - Enables a web-based "first-run" setup experience (like many web applications)
  - The Qt client can provide a proper UI for initial admin account creation

  2. Localhost-only security enforcement
  - The endpoint enforces that it can only be called from localhost (127.0.0.1 or
  ::1) at line
  projects/ores.accounts/src/messaging/accounts_message_handler.cpp:320
  - Provides network-accessible bootstrap with security guarantees
  - Prevents remote bootstrap attacks

  3. Atomic mode transition
  - The endpoint both creates the admin AND exits bootstrap mode in a single atomic
   operation (lines 362-367 in accounts_message_handler.cpp)
  - Guarantees consistency - can't create admin without exiting bootstrap mode

  4. Service-layer validation
  - Goes through full service layer with password validation and business logic
  - The CLI is essentially an "administrative backdoor" that bypasses the service
  layer and writes directly to the database

  5. Protocol-compliant workflow
  - Clients speaking the binary protocol need a proper bootstrap endpoint
  - REPL create_account_request is blocked in bootstrap mode (by enforcement logic)
  - create_initial_admin_request is the only endpoint that works in bootstrap mode

  The Distinction

  - CLI approach: Administrative backdoor, direct database access, bypasses all
  service logic
  - create_initial_admin_request: Proper network-accessible bootstrap flow with
  localhost restriction and atomic mode transition
  - REPL create_account_request: Normal account creation, blocked in bootstrap mode

  The create_initial_admin_request enables a proper "first-run experience" for
  clients connecting via the network protocol, while maintaining security through
  localhost-only access.



*** Cli clean-ups                                                      :code:

- we still seem to support =--entity currencies=. This should now be invalid.
  Done.
- we are still exporting as JSON. We should instead allow CSV and XML exports
  only.
- add recipes for all commands.
- should be able to list all admin accounts.
- list command should support table output.
- is admin should be a bool: =--is-admin arg (=0)=
- add account duplicates logic. We should have a single service for this.
- split application into entities.

*** Add search to currencies                                           :code:

It should be possible to filter the open currencies by a string. This should be
any field. The user needs to know when the list has been filtered. Ideally we
should have buttons at the top per field and filter using those. It should go
back to database rather than just filter what is available in UI.
