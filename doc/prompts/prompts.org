Perform a fast, focused code review on the code I’ll show you.

Look for:

- Obvious bugs or logic errors
- Missed opportunities to use C++23 features
- Incorrect or unclear comments (improve them if needed)
- Security issues or unsafe patterns
- Inappropriate or missing logging (check log level and message clarity)
- Any other clear improvements worth noting
- For unit tests, ensure they are named correctly and have enough coverage

Be succinct — prefer clarity over grammar.

Output a short list of actionable items, ideally with suggested fixes.

The system uses Data-Oriented design for finance.

I’ll show you the header and implementation (if any) separately — comment on
them separately.
