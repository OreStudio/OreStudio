*** COMPLETED CTest shows only one test per test suite                 :code:

We need to be able to see individual tests and the reasons for their failures.

Notes:

- raised an issue with CMake.

- [[https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/cdash/2015-February/001544.html][[Cdash] How to send a JUnit result file to CDash server with CTest?]]

*** COMPLETED Clean up client parser                                   :code:
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2025-11-07 Fri 09:14]--[2025-11-07 Fri 09:24] =>  0:10
    :END:

It should use common infrastructure and read variables from the environment.

*** COMPLETED Add connect command line argument                        :code:
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2025-11-07 Fri 11:56]--[2025-11-07 Fri 13:15] =>  1:19
    :END:

To avoid leaking secrets it should be possible to supply a =--connect= in the
client. We still need a connect in case we want to reconnect.

Notes:

- clean up parser in client, not using common logging.
- add environment mapping to client.

*** COMPLETED Install Windows package on Windows machine              :infra:

    CLOCK: [2025-11-07 Fri 10:48]--[2025-11-07 Fri 10:58] =>  0:10
    :END:

We need to install and run the windows package and make sure it works. Check
console and GUI start. Also, check we can connect against local service and
against remove service.

Notes:

- application fails to start because QT6 DLLs are not in bin folder. It is also
  missing libssl. Adding vcpkg to presets copied a lot of the DLLs:

#+begin_src json
{
  "version": 3,
  "configurePresets": [
    {
      "name": "default",
      "generator": "Visual Studio 17 2022",
      "architecture": "x64",
      "toolchainFile": "$env{VCPKG_ROOT}/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake",
      "binaryDir": "build",
      "cacheVariables": {
        "X_VCPKG_APPLOCAL_DEPS_INSTALL": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
#+end_src

- services are now running and connecting to postgres. Managed to connect from
  Linux to Windows and log in. However, Qt UI won't start due to missing DLLs.
  Installed Qt from online downloader, need to figure out what is missing. Open
  a separate story to handle Qt issues.

At present we have a number of spurious warnings on both windows and OSX. Try to
see if we can get CDash to ignore them.

Notes:

- Raised a Kitware ticket.

We need to install the DMG and run the app.

We think the package does not have all of the dependencies, but this did not
work:

#+begin_src cmake
if(APPLE)
    install(CODE "
        # make sure the bundle is already on disk
        set(BU_CHMOD_BUNDLE_ITEMS TRUE)
        include(BundleUtilities)

        # full path to the real executable inside the bundle
        set(app_exe \"\${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/OreStudio.app/Contents/MacOS/OreStudio\")

        # directory where 3rd-party libraries will be copied
        set(libs_dir \"\${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/OreStudio.app/Contents/Frameworks\")

        # discover all prerequisites and copy/fix them
        fixup_bundle(\"\${app_exe}\" \"\" \"\${libs_dir}\")
    " COMPONENT Runtime)
endif()
#+end_src

We should ask someone with an OSX machine to test this.

- [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17974439/cant-use-fixup-bundle-to-create-a-portable-bundle-with-qt][SO: Can't use fixup_bundle() to create a portable bundle with Qt]]

*** COMPLETED Create a splash screen and gray background              :infra:
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2025-11-07 Fri 17:54]--[2025-11-07 Fri 18:57] =>  1:03
    CLOCK: [2025-11-07 Fri 16:49]--[2025-11-07 Fri 17:53] =>  1:04
    :END:

We need to replace the basic splash with something that looks slightly better.
We also need some kind of background for the initial screen when nothing is
selected, a bit like visual studio code.

*** Setup Qt properly on Windows                                       :code:

Seems like our package is still missing Qt DLLs. Use the windows tool to
determine what is missing. Consider installing Qt in the build machine via the
built packages.

*** Server must check database connectivity on startup                 :code:

At present the server only checks connectivity to database when a user requests
an operation. We need some kind of initial polling which puts the server in a
mode replying to all clients: "database not available". While this is happening,
it should keep polling the database and checking the connectivity.

*** Add SC script on windows to install ores.service                   :code:

We should package a trivial batch file that sets up the service on windows. We
should also consider adding a simple script to setup the service on Linux.
Ideally it should be done via the packaging step.

*** Package SQL scripts                                                :code:

We need to initialise the database on installation. The package should contain
all of the necessary SQL as well as a script to do it.

*** Resolve all of the OpenSSL leaks in valgrind                       :code:

We are freeing up open SSL memory and still have leaks. For now just apply the
suppression suggestions and deal with this later.

*** Add support for feature flags                                      :code:

We need a way to know if we are in bootstrap mode or not. Implement a generic
mechanism for feature flags.

Example chrome flag:

#+begin_quote
Temporarily unexpire M139 flags.

Temporarily unexpire flags that expired as of M139. These flags will be removed
soon. – Mac, Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, Android

#temporary-unexpire-flags-m139
#+end_quote

Components:

- name: human readable
- description
- id

*** Implement authentication bootstrap workflow                        :code:

Notes:

- when there are no accounts setup, the repl should say to the user that it
  needs to create an admin account.
- first account must be admin.
- once there is an account we need to make sure the user is logged in before we
  process most message types.

Mongo message:

#+begin_src logview
2020-06-09T13:26:51.391+0000 I  CONTROL  [initandlisten] ** WARNING: Access control is not enabled for the database.

#+end_src

Requirements:

#+begin_src markdown
# Authentication Bootstrapping Requirements

## R1: Initial System State (Bootstrap Mode)

The system **MUST** start in a special **"Bootstrap Mode"** where the only
permitted action is the creation of the initial Administrator account.

## R2: Access Control in Bootstrap Mode

While the system is in Bootstrap Mode:

- **R2.1: Allowed Endpoint:** The service **MUST** only expose and accept
  requests for a single endpoint: `POST /api/v1/accounts/create-admin` (or
  equivalent).
- **R2.2: Local-Only Restriction:** All requests to the allowed endpoint
  ,**MUST** originate from a **trusted local interface** (e.g., `127.0.0.1` or
  the server's designated internal IP range). Requests from any external/public
  IP address **MUST** be rejected.
- **R2.3: General Endpoint Rejection:** All other API endpoints (e.g., login,
  user creation, data access) **MUST** immediately return a $\mathbf{403}$
  ,**Forbidden** or $\mathbf{401}$ **Unauthorized** status, along with a clear
  message indicating the system is in setup mode.

## R3: Initial Admin Account Creation

The first account created through the allowed endpoint **MUST** adhere to the
following:

- **R3.1: Mandatory Admin Role:** The account **MUST** be assigned the highest
  level of **Administrator privileges** (`is_admin: true`).
- **R3.2: Strong Password Policy:** The request **MUST** be validated against a
  strong password policy (e.g., minimum 12 characters, requiring a mix of case,
  numbers, and symbols). Failure to meet this standard **MUST** result in a
  $\mathbf{400}$ **Bad Request** error.
- **R3.3: One-Time Execution:** The administrator creation process **MUST** only
  be allowed to succeed **exactly once**.

## R4: System State Transition

Upon successful creation of the first Administrator account (R3):

- **R4.1: State Change:** The system **MUST** immediately and atomically
  transition from **"Bootstrap Mode"** to **"Secure Mode"**. This state change
  ,**MUST** be persisted.
- **R4.2: Bootstrap Endpoint Deactivation:** The `POST
  /api/v1/accounts/create-admin` endpoint **MUST** be permanently disabled. Any
  subsequent request to this endpoint **MUST** return a $\mathbf{403}$
  ,**Forbidden** error.

## R5: Secure Mode Operation

Once the system is in **"Secure Mode"**:

- **R5.1: General Access Control:** All operational API endpoints **MUST** now
  enforce **full authentication and authorization**.
- **R5.2: Mandatory Login:** All users, including the newly created
  Administrator, **MUST** successfully complete a login process to obtain a
  valid session token before accessing any resource.
- **R5.3: Standard Account Creation:** The standard non-admin account creation
  endpoint (`POST /api/v1/accounts/create`) **MUST** become available, subject
  to any configured access controls (e.g., only open to logged-in Admins, or
  fully public).

*** Remove postgres passwords from github workflows                    :code:

As a quick hack we added the dev passwords to the workflows. We should really
generate these on the fly and supply them to the tests.

*** Allow supplying the postgres connection URI                        :code:

At present we are supplying all of the components for the connection. It may be
easier to allow the entire URI:

- connection-uri: The connection URI to connect to PostgreSQL. Example:
  =postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost/postgres=.

*** Consider adding log command line options to qt                     :code:

At present we have hard-coded logging options. However, maybe users should be
able to change the logging settings from the UI rather than having to restart
the app and supply command line options.

*** Investigate valgrind leak on sqlgen                                :code:

Is this a real leak:
