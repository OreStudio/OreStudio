This document contains the [[http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/product-backlog][product backlog]] for VisualOre.

* Product Vision

Here we define what we consider to be the [[http://www.scaledagileframework.com/vision/][the vision]] for the product; what
guides us when we think about the product and what can and cannot go into the
product backlog.

** Vision Statement

The vision for VisualOre is:

** Vision Quotes

* Release Checklist

Steps to create a new release.

** Close previous sprint

To be done on the last Sunday of the sprint.

1. Make a copy of current sprint backlog and name it current sprint + 1 but
   don't check it in.
2. Move all untouched stories into product backlog.
3. Close current sprint: close all open tasks, delete tasks we did not work on,
   update clocks.
4. Push commit and wait for builds. This ensures that if there are any failures
   you can fix them before the release tag.
4. Tag commit and sign it with key.
5. Push tag. You can generate new builds overnight.

** Open new sprint

To be done on the Monday morning of the new sprint.

1. Open new sprint, updating CMake version, README, GitHub, and decoration
   formatter tests. Build all and run tests (some will fail). This should all be
   in one commit.
2. Create a demo. Publish it on youtube.
3. Write up release notes, publish them in github.
4. When tag build is finished, unpack and copy binaries into release, announce
   on gitter, twitter and linked in.

* Stories

** Near

Stories we may get two in the next two or three sprints.


** Far

Stories that we want to capture, but won't work on for a while.

*** Support multiple ORE "toolchains"                                 :story:

Much like with an IDE, where one can have multiple toolchains configured, we
need to also support multiple versions of ORE. Unlike with IDEs, it may be
desirable to run computations with more than one version of ORE for comparison
purposes. This means we need a way to associate outputs with their ORE version.
This approach does not necessarily fit the existing example code, because these
have a single "output directory". However, we just need  way to associate N
toolchains with a given workspace or possibly component; when present, the
output directory starts to reflect the toolchain configuration. For example,
with CMake we use presets:

- =linux-clang-debug=
- =linux-clang-release=
- =linux-gcc-debug=
- =linux-gcc-release=

For ORE the only dimension under which variability is possible is the version.
We can then have pricing engine configurations that are either the same, or
possibly different:

- for a workspace;
- for a component;
- for a toolchain version.



*** Add faker support to model                                        :story:

vcpkg will support faker soon:

- [[https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pull/38583][#38583: [faker-cxx] add new port]]

When that is available, we should try to add support for it.

*** Base the compute approach on BOINC                                :story:

Copy the BOINC data model.

*** Create a set of fake currencies                                   :story:

We need to create fake data so we can explore the problem domain. This is
something to work on in the future. We can use LLMs to help with the fake data,
where it makes sense.

Example:
