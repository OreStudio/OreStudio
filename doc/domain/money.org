Money lies at the root of many things --- evil or otherwise --- so it's not
exactly surprising to find it at the heart of the Computational Finance
discipline. Its central role makes it a fitting point from which to start our
incursion into the domain, and our "trusty" old Wikipedia can speed us along
with a fairly reasonable [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money][working definition]] (/emphasis ours/):

#+name: definition_2_1
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.1*: Money is /any item or verifiable record/ that is /generally
accepted as payment/ for goods and services /and repayment of debts/, such as
taxes, in /a particular country/ or /socio-economic context/.
#+end_quote

The first key take-away here is that money is mostly a /social convention/,
based on use, and, typically, enforced by legal apparatus; that is how /general
acceptance/ emerges. In other words, money is able to fulfil its role largely
because the individuals within a society /will/ for it to act in that way,
irrespective of the means by which consensus is achieved (/e.g./, coercion).
This rather important but somewhat confusing notion underpins much of the power
of money and also many of its challenges. Since we tend to experience money as a
concrete, physical phenomena, it is difficult to penetrate through the fog of
custom and see it for what it really is --- more of an object of philosophy,
sociology or law rather than a real world thing. Because these ideas are so
terribly important, lets make them even clearer:

- Money works mostly because /we/ --- for sufficiently large definitions of /we/
  --- /believe/ that it works.
- When we stop believing in money, in sufficiently large numbers, it stops
  working.
- If we resume believing in money, in sufficiently large numbers, it starts
  working again.
- Force may assist in creating belief, but its neither a necessary nor a
  sufficient condition.
- Because the belief is so deeply held, we mistakenly equate it to a natural
  law[fn:natural_law].
- It is difficult to get people to start or stop /believing/; belief emerges as
  part of a long historical process.

[fn:kernel] The kernel of these ideas forms part of a recurring theme that
permeates this entire text. We will attempt to make the kernel more explicit in
[[id:8D7F5CE2-FA9F-53F4-D373-D9B3A21BEC69][Finance and Modeling]].

[fn:natural_law] Alas, though the term "law" is bandied about a lot in
Computational Finance, there are no real /laws/ in the discipline --- at least
not as far as they are understood in the hard sciences. As the term is used in a
much less rigorous way, we'll try our best to avoid it. For a discussion on this
topic, see [[id:8D7F5CE2-FA9F-53F4-D373-D9B3A21BEC69][Finance and Modeling]].


Clearly, most of these notions fly in the face of the common sense understanding
of money, so the reader may not find them entirely convincing; they aren't
particularly reassuring either. Unfortunately, we must not lose ourselves in
philosophical debate this early in the proceedings, so we'll have to let these
words linger and leave it at that for now. However, do keep in mind that this is
the standpoint from which the remainder of this work is anchored[fn:kernel].

A second take-away from *[[definition_2_1][Definition 2.1]]* is perhaps even broader in its
consequences: the fact that any form of /verifiable record/ can be considered
money. The full implications of this notion can only be made apparent by
analysing the /kinds/ of money in existence, which we shall do later on (/c.f./
[[id:FCC97499-78A9-F4B4-1F6B-3144AAD74933][Kinds of Money]]).

The third and final point we'd like to extract from *[[definition_2_1][Definition 2.1]]* is related
to the use of money for /payments/ of goods and services and the /repayment/ of
debts; these can be thought of as money's /use cases/ or /applications/. This
notion can be further generalised into a set of /functional/ attributes, which
the next section will cover in detail.
