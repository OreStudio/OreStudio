* When to use this skill

When you need to configure, build, test, or deploy ORE Studio using CMake.

* How to use this skill

1. Identify what operation you need to perform (configure, build, test,
   deploy, generate diagrams).
2. All commands must be executed from the top-level project directory.
3. Follow the appropriate command from the Detailed instructions section below.
4. Default to =linux-clang-debug= preset when on Linux unless otherwise
   specified.
5. If you need to inspect the output of the build, see section Output directory
   layout.


* Detailed instructions

** Listing and choosing presets

To see all available CMake presets:

#+begin_src sh
cmake --list-presets
#+end_src

The default preset for Linux is =linux-clang-debug=. For release builds, use =linux-clang-release=.

** Configuring the project

To configure the project with a specific preset:

#+begin_src sh
cmake --preset linux-clang-debug
#+end_src

For release configuration:

#+begin_src sh
cmake --preset linux-clang-release
#+end_src

** Building the project

To build the entire project:

#+begin_src sh
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-debug
#+end_src

For release builds:

#+begin_src sh
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-release
#+end_src

** Running tests

*** Running all tests

To run all tests (target name: =rat=):

#+begin_src sh
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-release --target rat
#+end_src

*** Running specific component tests

To run tests for a specific component, use the pattern =test_COMPONENT_NAME=. For example, to run tests for =ores.accounts.tests=:

#+begin_src sh
cmake --build --target test_ores.accounts.tests --preset linux-clang-debug
#+end_src

Replace =ores.accounts.tests= with the desired component name.

** Deploying skills

To deploy Claude Code skills:

#+begin_src sh
cmake --build --target deploy_skills --preset linux-clang-debug
#+end_src

** Generating PlantUML Diagrams

To generate all PlantUML diagrams for the project:

#+begin_src sh
cmake --build --target mad --preset linux-clang-debug
#+end_src

** Deploying the site

To deploy the project website:

#+begin_src sh
cmake --build --target deploy_site --preset linux-clang-debug
#+end_src


* Output directory layout

The build output directory lives under =build/output=. There is a top-level
directory for the presets (e.g. =linux-clang-debug=, etc) and a top-level
directory for the site called =site=.

Within the preset directory:

- binaries are located under =publish/bin=.
- logs for applications are under =publish/log=.
- logs for tests are organised as follows:
  - they are under =publish/log/COMPONENT_TESTS= where =COMPONENT_TESTS=
    is the name of the component under test, e.g. =ores.accounts.tests=.
  - Inside, there is one folder per test suite, e.g. =domain_account_tests=,
    =domain_feature_flags_tests=, and so on. These must match the test suite
    implementation files (e.g.
    =projects/ores.accounts.tests/domain_account_tests.cpp=).
  - Inside the test suite folder, there is one log file per test, e.g.
    =account_serialization_to_json.log=. This must match the name of the unit
    test, e.g. =TEST_CASE("account_serialization_to_json", tags) {= in
    =projects/ores.accounts.tests/domain_account_tests.cpp=.
