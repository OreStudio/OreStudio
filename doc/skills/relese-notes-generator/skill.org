This skill generates release notes from a ORE Sprint Backlog file.

* When to Use This Skill

Use this skill whenever the user requests the generation of release notes for a
given sprint backlog.

* How to Use This Skill

1. Locate the sprint backlog for which to generate release notes. These are in
   folder =doc/agile/v0/=. The latest backlog is the one with the highest sprint
   number.
2. Read the sprint backlog and generate a summary following the instructions in
   section Detailed Instructions.
3. Generate the notes in markdown format and place them in a org-mode markdown
   block.
4. Place the resulting summary in a new section called "AI Generated Sprint
   Summary".

* Detailed Instructions

Follow the following template for the release notes, replacing with actual
content from sprint backlog.

#+begin_src markdown
# **ProjectName Sprint N – Release Notes**
,*Month Year*

A brief 1–2 sentence summary of the sprint’s primary focus and achievements.
---

## ✅ **Highlights**

- Use bullet points to list **3–5 major accomplishments**.
- Focus on high-impact features, architectural decisions, or process improvements.
- Keep each item short and outcome-oriented.

## 🛠️ **Key Improvements**

Organize improvements into **thematic sections** (e.g., Architecture, UI, Testing, Infrastructure).

- Use bold section headers (e.g., `### **Authentication & Security**`).
- Under each, list specific changes as bullet points.
- Include technical details where relevant (e.g., libraries used, patterns applied).
- Group related stories logically; avoid listing every task.

## ⚠️ **Known Issues & Postponed**

- List **BLOCKED**, **POSTPONED**, or unresolved issues.
- For each, provide a **short reason** or status (e.g., "Deferred to next sprint", "Waiting on upstream fix").
- Do not include resolved or cancelled items.

## 📊 **Time Summary**

- Show total effort: `**Total effort**: Xh Ym`
- Show effort distribution: `**Code**: A% | **Infra**: B% | **Agile/Analysis/Doc**: C%`
- List top time-consuming tasks with durations (e.g., `Top tasks: Task A (8h), Task B (6h)`)
