/Identity and Access Management (IAM)/ is the core security component of a
system responsible for governing and enforcing access to all system resources.
It ensures that only authenticated and authorized entities - whether users,
services, or hardware - can interact with applications, data, and infrastructure
according to the defined policies.

Core Responsibilities:

- *Identity Lifecycle Management*: Manages the digital identity of all entities
  (users, systems, applications), including their creation, provisioning,
  maintenance, and decommissioning.
- *Authentication*: Verifies the identity of an entity attempting to access the
  system (/e.g./, via passwords, certificates, or protocols).
- *Authorisation*: Controls what actions an authenticated identity is permitted
  to perform on specific resources based on assigned roles and policies.
- *Access Control Enforcement*: Technically enforces authorization decisions
  across the ecosystem, ensuring access rights are adhered to during operation.
  See [[id:3CAA394F-E84C-3434-331B-6E664F7E84D2][RBAC]] for more details.

Operational Scope:

The IAM module operates across two primary phases:

- *Configuration Phase*: The definition and registration of identities, their
  roles, and their authorized access rights.
- *Operation Phase*: The real-time execution of identification, authentication,
  and access control checks based on the configured policies.

In essence, this module centralizes the policy framework and technical
mechanisms that secure the system by guaranteeing the principle of least
privilege: the right access for the right entity to the right resource.
