*** Investigate build warning for qtbase                              :infra:

At present we are getting:

#+begin_src
Building qtbase[brotli,concurrent,core,dbus,dnslookup,doubleconversion,egl,fontconfig,freetype,gui,harfbuzz,icu,jpeg,network,opengl,openssl,pcre2,png,sql,sql-psql,sql-sqlite,testlib,thread,widgets,xcb,xcb-xlib,xkb,xkbcommon-x11,xlib,xrender,zstd]:x64-linux@6.8.3#5...
CMake Warning at ports/qtbase/portfile.cmake:49 (message):
  qtbase currently requires packages from the system package manager.  They
  can be installed on Ubuntu systems via sudo apt-get install '^libxcb.*-dev'
  libx11-xcb-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxrender-dev libxi-dev libxkbcommon-dev
  libxkbcommon-x11-dev libegl1-mesa-dev.
#+end_src

According to grok:

#+begin_quote
The CMake warning from ports/qtbase/portfile.cmake indicates that the qtbase
package in vcpkg requires additional system dependencies (like libxcb and
others) to be installed on your system, specifically for Ubuntu. This warning
appears because vcpkg detects that these dependencies are not satisfied. To
remove the warning, you need to install the required system packages or suppress
the warning if youâ€™re sure the dependencies are met or not needed.
#+end_quote

We seem to be installing all of the required libraries on our script. We may
need to:

#+begin_src bash
export VCPKG_DISABLE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_CHECK=1
#+end_src

*** Fix gemini cli action                                              :code:

The action to review PRs using gemini is failing.

*** Tidy-up database code                                              :code:

- add helpers to utility to ensure success, execute query, etc.
- add helpers for max timestamp, timestamp.

*** Split console recipes by entity                                    :code:

At present we have one very long file, but this is not scalable. We could split
out:

- general args (help, info, etc)
- by entity

Notes:

- Rename console to CLI.
- reduce output, only first few entries are needed.
- add a toc.

*** Merge client into console                                          :code:

We don't really need a client, we can add this functionality to console.

Notes:

- rename console to cli.
- add a mode in console called =client=.
- add port, etc as configuration variables.
- add the location of cert as configuration variables.
- read variables from environment.

*** Add support for JWT                                                :code:

*** Add session support                                                :code:

Users must be able to login and logout.

*** Consider exposing end points via HTTP                              :code:

Having a binary protocol is helpful for performance but it may make life easier
to expose some functionality via HTTP.

*** Consider using sqls for LSP                                        :code:

We are presently testing postgrestools. If that does not work well, we should
consider sqls.

*** Add workspace as a container                                       :code:
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2025-02-13 Thu 22:18]--[2025-02-13 Thu 22:35] =>  0:17
    CLOCK: [2025-02-13 Thu 21:21]--[2025-02-13 Thu 22:17] =>  0:56
    :END:

Core needs to have a container for all of the data stored within a context.

*** Convert plantuml diagrams to org-babel                              :doc:

It may be easier to integrate diagrams with roam if they are org-mode documents.
Experiment with babel for this.

*** Setup code quality actions                                        :infra:

We added a test password to the repo on purpose to see if it was going to be
detected by the github actions:

#+begin_src c++
    std::string connection_string("postgresql://ores:ores@localhost:5433/oresdb");
#+end_src

It wasn't. We need to figure out which actions need to be setup for this. Add
any other actions we may be missing.

The build seems to be failing:

#+begin_src sh
-- SCCache NOT found.
 CMake Error at /usr/local/share/cmake-3.30/Modules/CMakeDetermineSystem.cmake:152 (message):
   Could not find toolchain file:

#+end_src

This may be due to a missing sub-module for vcpkg.

*** Add a message queue                                                :code:

Links:

- [[https://www.oliverlambson.com/pgmq][Use what you already have: Building a message queue on Postgres]]

*** Add support for =windows-msvc-clang-cl=                           :infra:

We need to setup a build for MSVC clang.

*** Implement database connectivity                                    :code:

We have hard coded database configuration. Implement this properly both for
console and UI.

*** Starting UI from file manager does not work                       :infra:

At present we can't start the Qt UI because the file manager thinks its a video.
Maybe we need a desktop file.

Example desktop file:

#+begin_src conf
[Desktop Entry]
Comment=
Terminal=true
Name=fixvideo
Exec=/home/user/fixvideo.sh %f
Type=Application
Icon=/usr/share/icons/gnome/48x48/apps/gnome-settings-theme.png
Encoding=UTF-8
Hidden=false
NoDisplay=false
Categories=AudioVideo;Player;Recorder;
MimeType=video/dv;v
#+end_src

Source: [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/58037/is-there-a-standard-mode-for-ini-files][Is there a standard mode for .ini files?]]

Tasks:

- create a desktop file for the application.
- add an icon.

*** Consider adding the update copyrights action from quantlib        :infra:

We should remove copyrights from each file and instead have it only at the
top-level to make maintenance easier.

See [[https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/QuantLib/blob/master/.github/workflows/copyrights.yml][=copyrights.yml=]] in QuantLib repo.

*** Consider adding clang-tidy build                                  :infra:

As per QuantLib build: [[https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/QuantLib/blob/master/.github/workflows/tidy.yml][=tidy.yml=]].

*** Consider adding test times build                                  :infra:

As per QuantLib build: [[https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/QuantLib/blob/master/.github/workflows/test-times.yml][=test-times.yml=]].

*** Consider adding sanitizer build                                   :infra:

As per QuantLib build: [[https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/QuantLib/blob/master/.github/workflows/sanitizer.yml][=sanitizer.yml=]].

*** Use string views for static strings                               :infra:

We are creating =std::strings= where we don't need them, use string views
instead.

This is not trivial, when we tried a lot of things were borked.

*** Create HTTP end point for currencies                              :infra:

Add a basic HTTP server using boost beast. Then we just need a couple of verbs:

- GET: return all currencies in database.
- POST: add one or more currencies.

*** Fix site links to main page                                         :doc:

At present we renamed readme to index in the HTML export. Do a symlink or a copy
of this file to fix links.

*** Add discord support to app                                        :infra:

Links:

- [[https://github.com/RealTimeChris/DiscordCoreAPI][DiscordCoreAPI]]

*** Recipes do not show variables in org-babel                        :infra:

At present when we look at a recipe in the site, we cannot tell what the
environment variables are:

#+begin_src sh
./ores.console import ${log_args} --currency-configuration ${currency_config_dir}/currencies.xml
#+END_SRC

It would be nice if =log_args= etc showed up in the recipe.

*** Install Windows package on Windows machine                        :infra:

We need to install and run the windows package and make sure it works. Check
console and GUI start.

*** Install OSX package on OSX machine                                :infra:

We need to install and run the windows package and make sure it works. Check
console and GUI start.

*** Add packaging support for images                                  :infra:

At present we are not adding images to packages.

*** Create a staging directory                                        :infra:

At present the binaries are scattered around the build directory. We should take
the same approach as Dogen and create clean directories for this.

*** Create an icon for the application                                :infra:

We copied the Dogen icon to get us going. We should really grab our own logo.

*** Add JSON parsing support for currency                              :code:

We need to have the ability to read and write currencies from JSON.

*** Add postgres support for currency                                  :code:

We need to have the ability to read and write currencies from a postgres
database.

*** Work through all types required for Example 1                      :code:

We want to be able to visualise all the data types needed in order to be able to
run the most basic example of ORE. For each of these types, create a stories.

The files are as follows. First, there are the files in the =Input= directory:

- [[https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine/tree/master/Examples/Example_1/Input][Example 1 Inputs]]

Specifically:

- =currencies.xml=
- =netting.xml=
- =ore.xml=
- =ore_swaption.xml=
- =plot.gp=
- =portfolio.xml=
- =portfolio_swap.xml=
- =portfolio_swap_20151023.xml=
- =portfolio_swaption.xml=
- =portfolio_swaption_20151023.xml=
- =simulation.xml=

In addition, we need all of the common inputs under:

- [[https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine/tree/master/Examples/Input][Examples - Common Inputs]]

These are:

- =calendaradjustment.xml=
- =conventions.xml=
- =currencies.xml=
- =curveconfig.xml=
- =fixings_20160205.txt=
- =market_20160205.txt=
- =market_20160205_flat.txt=
- =pricingengine.xml=
- =todaysmarket.xml=

Finally, we need support for the outputs. We can grab these from the expected
outputs:

- [[https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine/tree/master/Examples/Example_1/ExpectedOutput][Example 1 Expected Outputs]]

These are:

- =colva_nettingset_CPTY_A.csv=
- =curves.csv=
- =exposure_nettingset_CPTY_A.csv=
- =exposure_trade_Swap_20y.csv=
- =flows.csv=
- =log_progress.json=
- =netcube.csv=
- =npv.csv=
- =swaption_npv.csv=
- =xva.csv=
