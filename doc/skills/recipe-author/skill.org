* When to use this skill

Use this skill when:
- The user wants to add recipes for a new topic or subsystem
- A new component needs executable documentation
- The user wants to create a skill to maintain existing recipes
- You need to understand the recipe and recipe-skill patterns

* How to use this skill

1. Identify the topic for the new recipes (e.g., SQL, shell, CLI, git).
2. Create the recipe file following the established pattern.
3. Optionally create a recipe-updating skill if the recipes have a source of
   truth that needs synchronization.
4. Link the new recipes to the main index and related documentation.
5. See Detailed instructions for the complete process.

* Detailed instructions

** Recipe file overview

Recipes are executable org-mode notebooks stored in =doc/recipes/=. They
demonstrate functionality through runnable code blocks with captured results.

** Existing recipe files

| File                | Topic                    | Source of truth           |
|---------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------|
| =shell_recipes.org= | ORE Studio Shell (REPL)  | C++ command files         |
| =cli_recipes.org=   | ORE Studio CLI           | C++ entity parser files   |
| =sql_recipes.org=   | SQL database queries     | SQL schema files          |
| =git_recipes.org=   | Git operations           | None (general reference)  |

** Creating a new recipe file

*** Step 1: Create the org-mode file

Create =doc/recipes/TOPIC_recipes.org= with this structure:

#+begin_src fundamental
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: GUID
:END:
#+title: TOPIC Recipes
#+author: Marco Craveiro
#+startup: inlineimages
#+options: <:nil c:nil todo:nil ^:nil d:nil date:nil author:nil toc:nil html-postamble:nil

Brief description of what these recipes demonstrate.

,* Recipes
  :PROPERTIES:
  :header-args: :exports both
  :header-args+: :results raw
  :header-args+: :dir PATH-TO-EXECUTABLES
  :END:

,** Section Name

,*** Recipe Name

Description of what this recipe demonstrates.

#+begin_src LANGUAGE :wrap WRAPPER
command or code here
#+end_src

| Previous: [[id:46F5ED07-9E63-77B4-2783-E0147EFF45D0][Recipes]] |
#+end_src

Replace:
- =GUID=: Generate with =python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"=
- =TOPIC=: The topic name (e.g., SQL, Shell, CLI)
- =PATH-TO-EXECUTABLES=: Relative path to binaries if needed
- =LANGUAGE=: Language for code blocks (sh, sql, python, etc.)
- =WRAPPER=: Output wrapper (example, src json, src xml, etc.)

*** Step 2: Organize recipes into sections

Group related recipes under =**= headings:

- *General*: Help, version, basic operations
- *Entity Operations*: CRUD for each entity type
- *Advanced*: Complex queries, administrative tasks

*** Step 3: Recipe block patterns

For shell commands:

#+begin_src fundamental
,*** Command Name

Description.

#+name: recipe-name
#+begin_src REPL-MODE :exports none
command1
command2
exit
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh :noweb yes :results output :wrap example
./executable ${args} << 'EOF'
<<recipe-name>>
EOF
#+end_src
#+end_src

For direct SQL:

#+begin_src fundamental
,*** Query Name

Description.

#+begin_src sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition;
#+end_src
#+end_src

For CLI tools:

#+begin_src fundamental
,*** Operation Name

Description.

#+begin_src sh :wrap src json
./ores.cli entity operation ${args} --option value
#+end_src
#+end_src

*** Step 4: Update the recipes index

Add a link in =doc/recipes/recipes.org=:

#+begin_src fundamental
- [[id:YOUR-GUID][TOPIC Recipes]]: Brief description.
#+end_src

*** Step 5: Cross-link to related documentation

Add navigation links at the bottom of your recipe file pointing to:
- The main recipes index
- Related modeling or component documentation

** Creating a recipe-updating skill

If your recipes have a source of truth (e.g., C++ source files, SQL schemas),
create a corresponding skill to help maintain synchronization.

*** When to create a recipe skill

Create a skill when:
- Recipes document features implemented elsewhere (code, schemas)
- The source of truth changes independently of recipes
- You want automated help detecting out-of-sync documentation

Don't create a skill when:
- Recipes are standalone reference material (like git tips)
- There's no authoritative source to compare against

*** Recipe skill structure

Create =doc/skills/ores-TOPIC-recipes/skill.org=:

#+begin_src fundamental
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: GUID
:END:
#+title: ORE TOPIC Recipes Skill
#+author: Marco Craveiro

,* When to use this skill

Use this skill when:
- The user wants to update the ORE Studio TOPIC recipes documentation
- New TOPIC features have been added and need to be documented
- Existing features have changed and recipes need updating

,* How to use this skill

1. Compare the SOURCE files to =doc/recipes/TOPIC_recipes.org=.
2. Identify any missing features that are not documented.
3. Add recipes for missing features following the existing pattern.
4. Use the Detailed Instructions section for the proper recipe format.

,* Detailed instructions

,** Recipe file location

The TOPIC recipes are stored in =doc/recipes/TOPIC_recipes.org=.

,** Source locations

SOURCE files are located in:
- =path/to/source1.EXT=: Description
- =path/to/source2.EXT=: Description

,** Recipe format

[Document the specific format for this recipe type]

,** Recipe sections

[Document the sections in this recipe file]

,** Adding a new recipe

*** Skill naming convention

Use =ores-TOPIC-recipes= for consistency with existing skills:
- =ores-shell-recipes=
- =ores-cli-recipes=
- =ores-sql-recipes= (if created)

** Existing recipe skills

| Skill                | Recipes file         | Compares against                          |
|----------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| =ores-shell-recipes= | =shell_recipes.org=  | =projects/ores.comms.shell/src/app/commands/*=  |
| =ores-cli-recipes=   | =cli_recipes.org=    | =projects/ores.cli/src/config/entity_parsers/*= |

** Best practices

1. *Executable examples*: All recipe code blocks should be runnable
2. *Captured output*: Include =#+RESULTS:= blocks showing expected output
3. *Clear descriptions*: Explain what each recipe demonstrates
4. *Logical grouping*: Organize recipes by feature area
5. *Cross-references*: Link to related documentation and components
6. *Temporal patterns*: For SQL recipes, always include the
   =valid_to = '9999-12-31 23:59:59'::timestamptz= filter for current records
