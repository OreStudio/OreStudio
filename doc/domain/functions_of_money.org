One way in which to define [[id:D564B035-80F8-0D04-B1DB-2832CD93B95B][money]] is to focus on its /functional characteristics/
--- that is to say, what can it be used for in practical terms. In the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money][before-mentioned]] page, Wikipedia goes on to state (/emphasis ours/):

#+name: definition_2_2
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.2*: The main functions of money are distinguished as: a /medium of
exchange/, a /unit of account/, a /store of value/ and sometimes, a /standard of
deferred payment/. Any item or verifiable record that fulfils these functions
/can be considered as money/.
#+end_quote

The first two functions are more or less self-explanatory; the latter two less
so, and somewhat interconnected. For good measure, we will provide a common
sense explanation of all four. A /medium of exchange/ is understood to mean that
money can be used as an intermediary to facilitate the exchange of goods and
services --- /i.e./ it is much more efficient than bartering goods or services
directly. A /unit of account/ brings money to the realm of arithmetic; it means
we can /assign numeric values/ to goods and services, and then to use these to
compute all sorts of measures related to accounting. These we shall cover in the
future.

A /standard of deferred payment/ in layperson's terms just means that if you
agree today to pay an amount in the future, when the day arrives, the agreed
amount is expected to have more or less the same properties. If there was a
collapse in belief and suddenly the money became worthless, it would not be very
useful for deferred payments. Similarly, if its value oscillated too much
through time, it would also make it unsuitable for deferred payments. In other
words, money is expected to preserve the majority of its value over time --- to
act as a /store of value/.

Taken as a whole, these four functions make money what it is. And, as the
definition stated, pretty much anything which can fulfil the functions above
/can be considered money/. However, the different types of /things/ used for
this purposes have very different characteristics, so its worthwhile looking at
them in more detail.
