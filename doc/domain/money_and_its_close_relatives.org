Finance is concerned with the relations between the values of securities and
their risk, and with the behavior of those values. It aspires to be a practical
field, like physics or chemistry or electrical engineering. As John Maynard
Keynes once remarked about economics, “If economists could manage to get
themselves thought of as humble, competent people on a level with dentists, that
would be splendid.” Dentists rely on science, engineering, empirical knowledge,
and heuristics, and there are no theorems in dentistry. Similarly, one would
hope that finance would be concerned with laws rather than theorems, with
behavior rather than assumptions. One doesn’t seriously describe the behavior of
a market with theorems.

As they say, it's always best to start a story at the beginning. However,
problem domains are not simple yarns that merely need unspooling. The very
notions of domain order and structure are artificial constructs, coarse
linearisations imposed by those attempting to make sense of the mess of concepts
and relationships between entities, as well as their behaviours. Because it is
imposed, such structure will always be inadequate; the task left to the writer
is to choose how inadequate the linear presentation is to be.[fn:wrong_models]

[fn:wrong_models] Box comes to mind: "All models are wrong but some are useful."
[cite:@box1979robustness]


These structural problems are particularly acute in finance and its sister
subject economics because, unlike other subjects, they are hostile environments
to the scientific method (/c.f./ [[id:8D7F5CE2-FA9F-53F4-D373-D9B3A21BEC69][Finance and Modeling]]). As Derman and Miller
informed us, "Markets are plagued with anomalies that violate standard financial
theories (or, more accurately, theories are plagued by their inability to
systematically account for the actual behaviour of markets)."
[cite:@derman2016volatility] It is important to take this subjectivity into
account as we enter our first foray into the domain. The next sections discuss
the core topics of the [[id:8BF323A0-B868-7AA4-EC7B-D988934482AA][Computational Finance]] domain.
