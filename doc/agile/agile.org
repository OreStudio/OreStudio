Task and time tracking activities.

* Product Backlog

Contains all of the captured stories that have not yet been assigned to a
sprint. Available here: [[id:558650A4-C3E5-8964-4193-7D9125E29B83][Product Backlog]].

* Sprint Backlogs

For each sprint, we capture all of the work we have undertaken. When it clocks
around eighty hours, we call it a sprint and make a release. Each sprint is
organised around one or two themes which we call the /Sprint Goals/. The last
sprint in the list is the active sprint - /i.e./ the sprint we are currently
working on. All other sprints are archives of past activity.
