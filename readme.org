* In a nutshell

ORE Studio is a graphical wrapper around [[https://www.opensourcerisk.org/][Acadia's]] [[https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine][Open Source Risk Engine (ORE)]],
which itself builds atop of [[https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib][QuantLib]]. Please note that this open source project
has *no affiliation whatsoever* with ORE or QuantLib, but you cannot understand
ORE Studio without at least a basic understanding of both of these projects.

[[./assets/images/ore_studio-v0.0.13.png]]

QuantLib is defined as follows:

#+begin_quote
The QuantLib project (https://www.quantlib.org) is aimed at providing a
comprehensive software framework for quantitative finance. QuantLib is a
free/open-source library for modeling, trading, and risk management in
real-life.
#+end_quote

ORE tells us that

#+begin_quote
The [[https://www.opensourcerisk.org/][Open Source Risk]] project aims at establishing a transparent peer-reviewed
framework for pricing and risk analysis that can serve as

- a benchmarking, validation, training, teaching reference
- an extensible foundation for tailored risk solutions

Open Source Risk Engine (ORE) provides

- contemporary risk analytics and value adjustments (XVAs)
- interfaces for trade/market data and system configuration (API and XML)
- simple application launchers in Excel, LibreOffice, Python, Jupyter
- various examples that demonstrate typical use cases
- comprehensive test suites

ORE is based on [[https://www.quantlib.org/][QuantLib]], the open source library for quantitative finance, and
it extends QuantLib in terms of simulation models, financial instruments and
pricing engines.
#+end_quote

/ORE Studio/ builds on top of ORE with the eventual aim of providing:

- persistent database storage for all of its inputs and outputs, with basic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete][CRUD]]
  support;
- graphical user interface both for data generation as well as data exploration;
- ability to configure and orchestrate ORE execution.

[[./assets/images/ore_studio_stack.png]]

The remainder of this document describes our approach in greater detail.

* Links

- [[https://github.com/OreStudio/OreStudio][GitHub]]: Most project interaction for developers occurs via GitHub.
- [[https://orestudio.github.io/OreStudio/][Website]]: Statically generated website with project documentation.

* Project Overview

The objective of this project is to create a simple User Interface for ORE, /for
didactic purposes/. Significantly, our intent is *not* to create a professional
tool for enterprise-grade use. We instead follow on the footsteps of those like
[[https://x.com/karpathy/status/1756380066580455557?lang=en][Karpathy]], who view learning as deeply enmeshed with the act of building.

With this in mind, our strategy is two-fold:

- to learn by /creating the tool itself/; and
- to create a tool specifically designed for others to learn, explore and
  experiment within the domain of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(finance)][quantitative finance]], both by using the tool
  as well as by extending it for their own purposes.

[[./assets/images/ore_studio-v0.0.12.png]]

The next section explains how we intend to go on about it.

** Approach

To attain our goals we have decided to remove as many infrastructural moving
parts as possible from the engineering stack. Most financial systems involve a
myriad of micro-services, a veritable zoo of storage technologies, assorted
messaging queues, orchestration engines and much, much more. Whilst these may be
deemed necessary for enterprise systems, we find them counterproductive from a
teaching perspective as they obscure considerably the underlying domain concepts
they purport to implement.

In stark contrast, ORE Studio will only ever have three layers: the /client/,
the /server/ and the [[https://www.postgresql.org/][Postgres]] relational database. This simple architecture has
several implications:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic][business logic]] will be divided between the server and database layers, as
  required; it is to be located wherever the implementation can be done with the
  least amount of complexity and the highest amount of clarity.
- unlike with enterprise-grade software, performance and scalability come
  /after/ clarity. That is to say that we shall try our best to make things fast
  /within/ the stated constraints. The one exception is the interactive
  experience, which is to be prioritised.
- we shall focus /exclusively/ on the latest versions of [[https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine][ORE]] and [[https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib][QuantLib]], and
  will not support any other Quant libraries or engines. ORE Studio is designed
  to be fused with these two technologies.
- finally, all of the heavy quantitative / mathematical lifting will reside
  exclusively within ORE and QuantLib; ORE Studio itself will contain as little
  quant logic as possible, making it more accessible to regular developers. Our
  focus is on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete][CRUD]] infrastructure and graphical presentation.

You may think this architecture is far too simple, and you are probably right.
We prefer to align ourselves with others such as Schmidt, and heed his call for
[[https://www.radicalsimpli.city/]["Radical Simplicity in Technology"]]:

#+begin_quote
As developers we love complexity. We create complexity with SPAs, Vue/React,
Transpiling, Typescript, Babel, Webpack, PureCSS, GraphQL, JSON, and on the
backend with microservices, protobuf, Kafka, InfluxDB, or NoSQL databases. This
complexity is accidental and not in the problem domain. This complexity slows us
down and makes development tiresome. This complexity leads to shallow domains.
Radical Simplicity makes development fast and joyful again.
#+end_quote

*** Technology

The implementation language of choice is [[https://isocpp.org/][C++]], for somewhat arbitrary reasons.
After many years of software engineering with it --- both [[https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen][academically]] as well
as professionally --- I have now found myself estranged from the language for
the last few years. This project is thus an opportunity for me to catch up with
the latest and greatest developments in the C++ ecosystem. Python would have
been a suitable alternative, particularly given its popularity with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(finance)][Quants]] and
Quant Devs. However, in the interest of simplicity, we'll stick to just the
/one/ language (other than [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL][SQL]] for the database, or course).

*** About the Author

I am the single maintainer of ORE Studio and thus its [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life][BFDL]]. If you want to know
more about me, do have a peek at [[https://mcraveiro.github.io/][my personal website]] --- the [[https://mcraveiro.github.io/about.html][about section]] in
particular. As with most open source projects, [[https://github.com/OreStudio/OreStudio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md][PRs are welcome]] but they must be
in the spirit of what has been described thus far. And you can always reach out
to our [[https://discord.gg/gcrYsjW3pd][discord channel]] for a chat.

* Project Documentation

All documentation for this project is kept within [[https://git-scm.com/][git]], right next to its source
code. It uses [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] to [[https://github.com/OreStudio/OreStudio/actions/workflows/build-site.yml][automatically generate]] its [[https://orestudio.github.io/OreStudio/][website]], in a
variation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]]. We also use [[https://www.orgroam.com/][org-roam]] internally to organise
our notes and [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org-babel]] to make code blocks executable where possible. Org-roam
is an implementation of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten][Zettelkasten method]], though you need not care too
much about it if you do not use Emacs; just browse through the content via [[https://orestudio.github.io/OreStudio/][the
website]] and start with "[[id:C0CF98E8-082F-2F04-2533-94B2DA9BE3D2][Documentation]]" as the entry point. Unfortunately this
only works via the website, so you will not see some of the links within
GitHub's rendering of the org-mode files.

If you do use Emacs, you can make use of a much richer roam experience. The file
[[https://github.com/OreStudio/OreStudio/blob/main/.dir-locals.el][.dir-locals.el]] is configured to generate a local roam database when you run:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-roam-db-sync)
#+end_src

This snippet, as well as many like it, is an executable snippet via org-babel.
Once you run it, you can then jump through all the pages using the normal
org-roam facilities.

Lastly, you may notice that this content is somewhat academic in tone. Though we
are not affiliated with any academic effort, I have kept a lot of bad habits
from my [[https://masd-project.github.io/progen/docs/masd_academic_papers.html#ID-5FA85AF3-E55C-B174-D943-1E2246CAEB14][days at university]] and these inform the approach --- for example how we
research prior art, organise the documentation, the use of [[https://github.com/OreStudio/OreStudio/blob/464525bd80e8cb5d69550bbcf06ed3da4e702966/doc/bibliography.bib][references]] and so on.
Nonetheless, rather than a research model, the project intends to be useful to
academics and practitioners alike, within its stated constraints. If you do want
to use the project for research, a [[https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/engage/doi-process][DOI]] will be made available in [[https://zenodo.org/][Zenodo]] when we
do our first release. Once sufficient functionality has been implemented to
justify the effort, we'll write a Technical Report describing the tool.

* Binary Packages

Binary packages are available for each release in [[https://github.com/OreStudio/OreStudio/releases][GitHub]], with the links shown
at the end of each release note. The binaries cover [[https://www.debian.org/][Debian Linux]] (though they
probably also work for [[https://ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]] and other flavours), [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS][MacOS]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows][Windows]] --- all
64-bit only. Packages are also generated per commit for each Operative System
and stored with the corresponding [[https://github.com/OreStudio/OreStudio/actions][GitHub Workflow]]. Development is done from the
[[https://github.com/OreStudio/OreStudio][main branch in git]], so latest should always be greatest; but you may want to use
packages from the [[https://orestudio.github.io/OreStudio/doc/agile/agile.html][previous sprint]] rather than what is currently under
development (see badges above).

Notes:

- Other than Linux, we do not test the packages frequently. If you find any
  issues with a binary package, please [[https://github.com/OreStudio/OreStudio/issues][raise an issue]].
- The OSX installer provides you with a DMG. Once you open it in Finder, it
  mounts under =/Volumes/=, /e.g/.:

#+begin_src sh
/Volumes/OreStudio-${VERSION}-Darwin/orestudio.app/Contents/Resources/bin
#+end_src

Where =${VERSION}= is your ORE Studio version, such as =0.0.14=.

* Building From Source

In order to build ORE Studio you will need a modern [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B][C++]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain][toolchain]]. On Linux and
OSX, you'll need a recent compiler with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B20][C++ 20]] support, such as [[https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc-13][GCC 13]] or [[https://releases.llvm.org/16.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html][Clang
14]], and [[https://ninja-build.org/manual.html][Ninja]] or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/][GNU Make]]. On Windows you'll need [[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/whatsnew/][Visual Studio 2022]]. On all
platforms, we make extensive use of [[https://cmake.org/][CMake]]. Older compilers may work, but we try
to always use the most recent releases. So, if you can, please try using to
those.

In terms of dependencies, though ORE Studio should build fine with
package-manager supplied libraries or even with hand-built dependencies, the
recommended way to setup a development environment on all supported platforms is
by using [[https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg][vcpkg]], which is what this document describes. ORE Studio uses the
"[[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73967245/why-is-vcpkg-recommended-as-a-git-submodule][sub-module setup]]", whereby vcpkg is a git submodule of ORE Studio. All of the
dependencies are declared in the [[https://github.com/OreStudio/OreStudio/blob/main/vcpkg.json][vcpkg.json]] file. Unfortunately, some of these
packages also have dependencies --- particularly on Linux. If you are on Debian
or Ubuntu, please run the script [[https://github.com/OreStudio/OreStudio/blob/main/build/scripts/install_debian_packages.sh][=build/scripts/install_debian_packages.sh=]]
prior to building. See the next section for details.

** Ubuntu, Debian and WSL

On a fresh [[https://ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]] or [[https://www.debian.org/][Debian]] installation --- including [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install][Windows Subsystem for
Linux (WSL)]] --- run the following to install all required tools and system
libraries in one step:

#+begin_src sh
./build/scripts/install_debian_packages.sh --full-install
#+end_src

This installs from the distro repositories: GCC, Clang, CMake, Ninja,
PostgreSQL (server and =libpq-dev=), Qt6 development packages
(=qt6-base-dev=, =libqt6charts6-dev=, etc.), Valgrind, and the X11/GL
headers needed to build Qt applications. Nothing is downloaded from
third-party APT repositories.

Once the script completes, initialise the database and proceed with the
normal build steps described below:

#+begin_src sh
./projects/ores.sql/recreate_database.sh
cmake --preset linux-clang-debug
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-debug
#+end_src

Our build makes use of [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html][CMake Presets]]. To know what these are you can either have
a look at the presets file [[https://github.com/OreStudio/OreStudio/blob/main/CMakePresets.json][CMakePresets.json]] or, better still, ask CMake:

#+begin_src sh :results verbatim html
cmake --list-presets
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_export html
Available configure presets:

  "linux-clang-debug"             - Linux Clang Debug
  "linux-clang-release"           - Linux Clang Release
  "linux-gcc-debug"               - Linux GCC debug
  "linux-gcc-release"             - Linux GCC Release
  "windows-msvc-debug"            - Windows x64 Debug
  "windows-msvc-release"          - Windows x64 Release
  "windows-msvc-clang-cl-debug"   - Windows x64 Debug
  "windows-msvc-clang-cl-release" - Windows x64 Release
  "macos-clang-debug"             - Mac OSX Debug
  "macos-clang-release"           - Mac OSX Release
#+end_export

For the remainder of this document we shall assume =linux-clang-release=, which
is our preferred preset. If it isn't yours, remember to update the preset name
to match your desired build.

To checkout ORE Studio, clone as follows:

#+begin_src sh :results verbatim html
git clone https://github.com/OreStudio/OreStudio.git --recurse-submodules
#+end_src

The =--recurse-submodules= is needed for the vcpkg submodule setup. As for the
configure step:

#+begin_src sh :results verbatim html
cd OreStudio
cmake --preset linux-clang-release
#+end_src

You can then build ORE Studio on all platforms as follows:

#+begin_src sh :results verbatim html
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-release
#+end_src

If you'd like to run the project tests, execute the target =run_all_tests= or
its abbreviation =rat=.

#+begin_src sh :results verbatim html
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-release --target rat
#+end_src

A quicker way to do all of these steps in one go is to use the [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html#workflow-preset][workflow preset]]:

#+begin_src sh
cmake --workflow --preset linux-clang-release
#+end_src

Last but not least, you can start the GUI via the target =run_ores_qt=:

#+begin_src sh
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-release --target run_ores_qt
#+end_src

Note: if you bump into posgres errors, do:

#+begin_src sh
ZIC=zic cmake --preset linux-clang-debug
#+end_src

* Updating vcpkg

Occasionally we need to pull latest vcpkg from the remote. To do so:

#+begin_src sh
cd vcpkg
git checkout master
git pull origin master
cd ..
git add vcpkg
#+end_src

Check the branch and then commit the update:

#+begin_src sh
git commit -m "[vcpkg] Update to 2025.07.25-765-g7220a4eebf"
#+end_src
