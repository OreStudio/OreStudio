 *
 * The service's codec holds the grammar. Each route forwards the structure and
 * returns the answer, so the gateway decides nothing about whether a URI is
 * valid and spells none. A URI the codec refuses is an answer and not a fault:
 * the read succeeds with the codec's words beside it, so an editor can show them
 * where the person is typing.
