* About FPML

Financial Products Markup Language (FPML) is a comprehensive XML-based schema for representing financial instruments and processes. Originally developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and other industry participants, FPML serves as a standard for pre-trade, trade, and post-trade electronic commerce in the global OTC derivatives markets. The language enables consistent representation of complex financial instruments including interest rate swaps, credit derivatives, equity derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives, and commodity derivatives. FPML facilitates straight-through processing (STP), reduces operational risk, and improves efficiency in trade processing by providing a common language for communication between market participants.
