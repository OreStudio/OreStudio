Role-based access control (RBAC) is a security method that restricts system
access to authorised users based on their job roles, rather than individual user
permissions. By grouping permissions into roles (/e.g./, =admin=, =user=),
organisations can simplify access management, enforce the principle of least
privilege, and enhance security.

* Key Components of RBAC

- *Roles*: Collections of permissions defining job functions (/e.g./, "Nurse",
  "Manager").
- *Permissions*: Specific rights to view, create, or modify data.
- *Users*: Individuals assigned one or more roles.

* Core Principles

- *Role-Based Assignment*: Users are assigned roles, and permissions are
  attached to those roles, not the user directly.
- *Least Privilege*: Users receive only the minimum permissions necessary for
  their role.
- *Separation of Duties (SoD)*: As described in [[https://www.ibm.com/br-pt/think/topics/rbac][IBM's research]], SoD prevents
  conflicts of interest by requiring multiple people to complete high-risk
  tasks.

* Benefits of RBAC

- *Simplified Management*: Reduces the overhead of managing permissions for
  thousands of users.
- *Increased Security*: According to the [[https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/access-management/role-based-access-control-rbac/][Cloudflare website]], it limits
  unauthorized access and reduces the risk of data leaks.
- *Compliance*: Facilitates adherence to data protection regulations.
