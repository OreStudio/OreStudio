 * @mainpage ORE Studio
 *
 * @brief **ORE Studio** is a graphical wrapper around Acadia's [Open Source
 * Risk Engine (ORE)](https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine), which itself is
 * built on top of [QuantLib](https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib). This
 * open-source project has **no affiliation whatsoever** with Acadia, ORE, or
 * QuantLib.
 *
 * @section overview_section Overview
 *
 * Understanding ORE Studio requires at least a basic familiarity with both
 * QuantLib and ORE. The following summaries are taken directly from their own
 * project descriptions.
 *
 * @subsection quantlib_subsection QuantLib
 *
 * QuantLib describes itself as:
 *
 * > The QuantLib project (https://www.quantlib.org) is aimed at providing a
 * > comprehensive software framework for quantitative finance. QuantLib is a
 * > free/open-source library for modeling, trading, and risk management in
 * > real-life.
 *
 * @subsection ore_subsection Open Source Risk Engine (ORE)
 *
 * ORE provides the following description:
 *
 * > The Open Source Risk project (https://www.opensourcerisk.org) aims at
 * > establishing a transparent peer-reviewed framework for pricing and risk
 * > analysis that can serve as:
 * >
 * > - a benchmarking, validation, training, teaching reference
 * > - an extensible foundation for tailored risk solutions
 * >
 * > Open Source Risk Engine (ORE) provides:
 * >
 * > - contemporary risk analytics and value adjustments (XVAs)
 * > - interfaces for trade/market data and system configuration (API and XML)
 * > - simple application launchers in Excel, LibreOffice, Python, Jupyter
 * > - various examples demonstrating typical use cases
 * > - comprehensive test suites
 * >
 * > ORE is based on QuantLib and extends it with simulation models, financial
 * > instruments, and pricing engines.
 *
 * @subsection orestudio_subsection ORE Studio Goals
 *
 * **ORE Studio** extends ORE with additional capabilities:
 *
 * - **Persistent Storage**: PostgreSQL database with temporal versioning for
 *   inputs and outputs, supporting full
 *   [CRUD operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)
 * - **Graphical Interface**: Qt 6-based desktop application with MDI interface
 *   for visual data creation and exploration
 * - **Import/Export**: Command-line tools for bulk operations with JSON, XML,
 *   and CSV formats
 * - **Client-Server Architecture**: SSL/TLS secured binary protocol for
 *   multi-client access
 * - **Orchestration Tools**: Configuration and execution management for ORE
 *   workflows
 *
 * @section arch_section Architecture
 *
 * ORE Studio is a C++20 application built on a layered architecture. The system
 * is organized into nine components across five layers:
 *
 * - **Foundation**: ores.utility (database, logging, filesystem utilities)
 * - **Infrastructure**: ores.comms (client-server protocol), ores.testing
 *   (test infrastructure)
 * - **Domain**: ores.risk (ORE domain model), ores.accounts (user management)
 * - **Application**: ores.cli (command-line tool), ores.qt (GUI), ores.service
 *   (server), ores.client (REPL command-line client)
 *
 * For a visual representation of the system architecture and component
 * dependencies, see the system diagram at `projects/modeling/ores.puml`. Each
 * component has its own class diagram showing detailed internal structure.
 *
 * For architectural details, see the ores namespace documentation.
 *
 * @section features_section Key Features
 *
 * @subsection data_management Data Management
 *
 * - Temporal database with version history tracking
 * - ORE XML native format support for interoperability
 * - JSON and CSV export for data analysis
 * - Full CRUD operations through GUI and CLI
 *
 * @subsection security Security & Authentication
 *
 * - Scrypt-based password hashing
 * - Account locking after failed login attempts
 * - SSL/TLS encrypted client-server communication
 * - Feature flags for runtime capability control
 *
 * @subsection development Development
 *
 * - Comprehensive test coverage with Catch2
 * - Database isolation for parallel test execution
 * - PlantUML component diagrams for architecture documentation
 * - CMake build system with vcpkg dependency management
 *
