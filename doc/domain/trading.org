Cash flows suggested the idea of events in time. Prior to any cash flowing,
however, there must be an agreement between parties to exchange items for money;
and a key precondition of any such agreement is for both parties to have the
ability to perform some kind of /valuation/ of the items in question. The term
/value/ was already introduced, but with a focus on use value (/c.f./ [[id:FCC97499-78A9-F4B4-1F6B-3144AAD74933][Definition
2.4]]) and intrinsic value (/c.f./ [[id:FCC97499-78A9-F4B4-1F6B-3144AAD74933][Definition 2.5]]). We shall now delve once more
into this crucial concept, but this time with the aim of extricating a
generalisation.

Wikipedia [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics)][tells us that]] (/emphasis ours/):

#+name: definition_2_15
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.15*: /Economic value/ is /a measure of the benefit/ provided by a
good or service to an economic agent. It is generally /measured relative to
units of currency/, and the interpretation is therefore "what is the maximum
amount of money a specific actor is willing and able to pay for the good or
service"?
#+end_quote

It is important to note that economic value is distinct from /price/, which is
instead [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price][defined as follows]] (/emphasis ours/):

#+name: definition_2_16
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.16*: A /price/ is the (/usually not negative/) quantity of payment
or compensation /given by one party to another/ /in return for one unit of goods
or services/.
#+end_quote

Before we proceed, please keep in mind that this is not the only possible
interpretation for these terms. Differing interpretations come bundled as part
of a larger body of economic concepts, called /theories of value/, and these can
be quite complex. Nonetheless, these coarse simplifications are quite adequate
for our goals, so we needn't explore alternatives [fn:suitability]. Secondly,
notice that the key distinction between value and price is that price implies
the agreement between parties as part of an exchange; for this reason, price is
also known as the /exchange value/. Last but certainly not least, we should
point out the /extremely important/ but somewhat hidden statement that gives a
hint to the numeric domain of prices: "/usually/ not negative". We shall not yet
go into details of how this can happen, but for now it suffices to say that in
some extremely unusual circumstances, one party may be required to
simultaneously pay the other party /and/ also supply the product. This is
modeled as a negative price, and systems must be designed with this eventuality
in mind.

[fn:suitability] They can, of course, be entirely unsuitable for other purposes,
so they must be used with care outside of our simplified world.


The third concept related to value is cost. By "cost" we mean /cost of
production/, which can be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Price&section=6#Confusion_between_prices_and_costs_of_production][defined as]] (/emphasis ours/):

#+name: definition_2_17
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.17*: /Cost of production/ concerns the /seller's expenses/
(/e.g./, manufacturing expense) in producing the product being exchanged with a
buyer.
#+end_quote

Needless to say, determining the /cost of production/ is in itself a very
complex subject, but we have chosen to completely ignore these details. The
general notion is that there are costs in producing an item, and that those
costs will have an influence on the price of the item, though these are two
distinct concepts. Alas, "price" is itself a simplified concept. In practice,
there are three interlinked notions of "price", all of which are extremely
important to Computational Finance (/emphasis ours/):

#+name: definition_2_18
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.18*: "Price" sometimes refers to the quantity of payment requested
by a seller of goods or services, rather than the eventual payment amount. This
requested amount is often called the /asking price/ or /selling price/, while
the actual payment may be called the /transaction price/ or /traded price/.
Likewise, the /bid price/ or /buying price/ is the quantity of payment offered
by a buyer of goods or services [...].
#+end_quote

The /traded price/ is of significance here; the exchange between parties is
performed in the context of a /trade/. Wikipedia [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade][informs us that]] (/emphasis
ours/):

#+name: definition_2_19
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.19*: /Trade/ involves the /transfer/ of goods or services /from
one person or entity to another/, often /in exchange for money/. Economists
refer to a system or network that allows trade as a /market/.
#+end_quote

The /indicative prices/ that the buyer and seller haggle over are known as
/quotes/, and defined [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_quote][as follows]] (/emphasis ours/):

#+name: definition_2_20
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.20*: A /financial quotation/ refers to specific market data
relating to a /security/ or commodity. While the term /quote/ specifically
refers to the /bid price/ or /ask price/ of an instrument, it may be more
generically used to relate to /the last price/ which the security /traded at/
("last sale").
#+end_quote

Since /security/ is a very important term, we should take this opportunity to
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)][define it]], as well as the related but somewhat more generic notion of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_instrument][an
instrument]] (/emphasis ours/):

#+name: definition_2_21
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.21*: A /security/ is a /tradable financial asset/. The term
commonly refers to /any form of financial instrument/, but its legal definition
varies by jurisdiction. In some countries and languages the term "security" is
commonly used in day-to-day parlance to mean any form of financial instrument,
even though the underlying legal and regulatory regime may not have such a broad
definition.
#+end_quote

#+name: definition_2_22
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.22*: /Financial instruments/ are /monetary contracts between
parties/. They can be created, traded, modified and settled. They can be cash
(currency), evidence of an ownership interest in an entity or a contractual
right to receive or deliver [...].
#+end_quote

With this, the basic vocabulary has been established. All of these moving parts
can now be assembled together to form an overall picture in the following
manner. A /seller/, that is, /a party/ with items to sell, comes up with a
/valuation/ for the items --- called the /asking price/ or just /ask/; a
/buyer/, that is, /a party/ wishing to buy items, also has its own valuation ---
called the /bidding price/ or just /bid/. They come to /a market/ to conduct
their negotiation. If the buyer and the seller can agree on terms, /a
transaction/ is made --- called a /trade/ or a /deal/. Prices are generally
/quoted/ in /currency units/. In the domain of Computational Finance, the items
of interest are /financial products/, also known as /financial instruments/, and
the markets in which these are traded are called /financial markets/. The term
/financial/ is often omitted for brevity.

There is one wrinkle in this picture. In a typical /public/ financial market,
not all parties are able to /make prices/. That is, the buyer normally does not
tell the seller directly its asking price, as you would when you are conducting
an informal negotiation at your local market. Instead, there exists a group of
privileged entities who are responsible for quoting /both sides/ of a price,
making what is known as a /2-way price/ --- /i.e./ providing /both/ the bid
/and/ the ask at which they are willing to transact. These are known as /market
makers/ and their role is defined [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_maker][as follows]]:(/emphasis ours/):

#+name: definition_2_23
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.23*: A /market maker/ or /liquidity provider/ is a company or an
individual that quotes both /a buy and a sell price/ in a /financial instrument/
or /commodity/ held in inventory, hoping to make a profit on the /bidâ€“ask
spread/, or turn. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission defines a "market
maker" as a firm that stands ready to /buy and sell/ stock on /a regular and
continuous basis/ /at a publicly quoted price/.

Figure [[uml_domain_concepts][uml_domain_concepts]] puts together all of the concepts we've introduced
and, with it, we complete this part's domain survey. Next, we shall round up
this information by placing it in a broader, and somewhat more philosophical,
context.
