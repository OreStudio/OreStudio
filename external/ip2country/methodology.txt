## Data Source

The IP to country mapping data is sourced from iptoasn.com, which provides
free IP address to ASN (Autonomous System Number) and country mappings
derived from BGP routing data.

## Data Format

The data is provided as a TSV file with IPv4 ranges expressed as unsigned
32-bit integers:

- range_start: First IP address in the range (as u32)
- range_end: Last IP address in the range (as u32)
- country_code: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, or "None" for unrouted ranges

## Update Frequency

iptoasn.com updates their data regularly based on BGP routing changes.
For most use cases, monthly updates are sufficient.

## Download Instructions

1. Visit https://iptoasn.com/
2. Download "ip2country-v4-u32.tsv.gz"
3. Extract the gzip file
4. Replace the existing ip2country-v4-u32.tsv file

## Data Quality Notes

- Some IP ranges map to "None" (unrouted or reserved)
- Country codes follow ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard
- Data accuracy depends on BGP routing information
