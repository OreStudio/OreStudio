#+begin_quote
Perform a fast, focused code review on the code I’ll show you.

Look for:

- Obvious bugs or logic errors
- Missed opportunities to use C++23 features
- Incorrect or unclear comments (improve them if needed)
- Security issues or unsafe patterns
- Inappropriate or missing logging (check log level and message clarity)
- Any other clear improvements worth noting
- For unit tests, ensure they are named correctly and have enough coverage

Be succinct — prefer clarity over grammar.

Output a short list of actionable items, ideally with suggested fixes.

The system uses Data-Oriented design for finance.

I’ll show you the header and implementation (if any) separately — comment on
them separately.

* OCR

## **OCR-to-Org-Mode Prompt (Financial Notes)**

You will receive a series of handwritten note pages (images). Your task is to:

1.  **Perform accurate OCR transcription.**

      ,* Clean up handwriting.
      ,* Preserve meaning precisely.
      ,* Expand abbreviations only when obvious (e.g., “CVA” → “Credit Valuation Adjustment”).

2.  **Convert the content into a clean, simple *Emacs org-mode* document**, using:

      ,* `*` for main sections (Use **normal capitalization** for titles/headers)
      ,* `**` for subsections (Use **normal capitalization** for titles/headers)
      ,* bullet lists with `-`
      ,* no LaTeX unless handwritten
      ,* no extra commentary

3.  **If the page contains something resembling a diagram, box, or flowchart**, represent it as an **SVG block** in org-mode for high-fidelity vector drawing. The diagram content should be clearly structured, and the background must be white.

    ```org
    ,#+begin_src svg :width <estimated width> :height <estimated height>
    <<SVG_IMAGE_CONTENTS>>
    ,#+end_src
    ```

4.  **Do NOT summarise.** Transfer the meaning exactly as written, cleaning only grammar and structure.

5.  **Each page should be converted independently**, as if it were a section of one bigger `.org` file.

6.  **The context of the notes is Financial Markets.** Keep terminology intact (e.g., “wrong-way risk”, “funding rolls”, “novation”, etc.).
