* Code Review

Used successfully in Gemini 2.5 Flash, ChatGPT.

#+begin_quote
Perform a fast, focused code review on the code I’ll show you.

Look for:

- Obvious bugs or logic errors
- Missed opportunities to use C++23 features
- Incorrect or unclear comments (improve them if needed)
- Security issues or unsafe patterns
- Inappropriate or missing logging (check log level and message clarity)
- Any other clear improvements worth noting
- For unit tests, ensure they are named correctly and have enough coverage

Be succinct — prefer clarity over grammar.

Output a short list of actionable items, ideally with suggested fixes.

The system uses Data-Oriented design for finance.

I’ll show you the header and implementation (if any) separately — comment on
them separately.

* OCR

OCR to Org-Mode Prompt for Financial Notes.

#+begin_quote
You will receive a series of handwritten note pages (images). Your task is to:

1. This is a new chat. do not use your memory.

2. Perform accurate OCR transcription.

  - Clean up handwriting.
  - Preserve meaning precisely.
  - Expand abbreviations only when obvious (e.g., “CVA” → “Credit Valuation
    Adjustment”).

3. Convert the content into a clean, simple Emacs org-mode document, using:

  - =*= for main sections. Use normal capitalization for titles/headers.
  - =**= for subsections. Use normal capitalization for titles/headers.
  - =-= bullet lists with "-"
  - no LaTeX unless handwritten
  - no extra commentary

4. If the page contains something resembling a diagram, box, or flowchart,
   represent it as a separate PNG image. The diagram content should be clearly
   structured, and the background must be white.

5. Do NOT summarise. Transfer the meaning exactly as written, cleaning only
   grammar and structure where absolutely necessary.

6. Each page should be converted independently, as if it were a section of one
   bigger =.org= file.

7. The context of the notes is Financial Markets. Keep terminology intact
   (/e.g./, “wrong-way risk”, “funding rolls”, “novation”, etc.).

8. Output formatting - strict:

   - *ONLY* output the raw Org-mode text.
   - *DO NOT* wrap the output in Markdown code blocks (/e.g./, do not use =```org ... ```=).
   - *DO NOT* include any conversational text, introductions, or conclusions
     (/e.g./, "Here is the transcription...").
   - Start directly with the first header or content line.

Do not output any content which is not provided from the image to ocr.

Do you understand these instructions?

* Spec for new feature

#+begin_quote
Consider this idea for a new feature:

<story summary here>

Interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything:
technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the
questions are not obvious

be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete,
then write a detailed user story with a specification to the current agile
backlog as per skill doc/skills/agile-product-owner/skill.org. If you think the
work is too large for a single story, break it into several stories, each of
which will have it's own PR.
