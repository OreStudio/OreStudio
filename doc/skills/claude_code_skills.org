* Rebuilding skills

If you add new skills or update existing skills, you need to redeploy them to
claude. First regenerate them then ask Claude to reload and list the available
skills. To regenerate, run the =deploy_skills= target:

#+begin_src sh :dir ../../ :noweb yes :results output :wrap example :exports both
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-debug --target deploy_skills
#+end_src
