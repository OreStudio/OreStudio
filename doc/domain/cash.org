Not all money is treated in the same way. There is an obvious difference between
having some hard currency in your pocket versus having the same amount deposited
in a bank; the former is easier to access (and spend) when compared to the
latter[fn:contactless]. Building up on this simple intuition, a generalisation
of this notion can be made, and is given the name of /cash/. Wikipedia defines
it [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash][like so]] (/emphasis ours/):

[fn:contactless] In these days of contactless payments, you may beg to differ.
Bear in mind, however, that you still need the payment infrastructure in order
for contactless to work, whereas you do not for hard currency. In a scenario
where the payment networks run into issues, hard currency would suddenly be at a
premium.


#+name: definition_2_10
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.10*: In economics, /cash/ [...] is /money in the physical form of
currency/, such as banknotes and coins. In bookkeeping and finance, /cash is
current assets/ comprising currency or /currency equivalents/ that /can be
accessed immediately or near-immediately/ [...].
#+end_quote

The idea of "varying degrees of immediacy" with regards to access jumps out of
this definition, as does the word /assets/. This term has a very important
meaning, if somewhat difficult to pin down in a precise manner. As always, we
must start with Wikipedia's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset][attempt at a definition]] (/emphasis ours/):

#+name: definition_2_11
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.11*: In financial accounting, an /asset/ is /any resource owned/
by the business. Anything /tangible or intangible/ that can be owned or
controlled to produce value and that is held by a company to produce positive
economic value is an asset. Simply stated, /assets represent value of ownership/
that can be /converted into cash/ (although /cash itself is also considered an
asset/).
#+end_quote

*[[definition_2_11][Definition 2.11]]* nicely rounds up the circle; there is the idea that "an
entity" (a business) can own "things" (assets), and that these things have a
monetary value (though how exactly that is determined is not our concern just
yet). There is also some kind of "conversion function" which enables us to go
from "things" into the most basic representation of value --- in this case cash
--- and vice-versa.

We have already mentioned bank money and deposits. They are of course assets,
but they belong to a /special group/ of assets --- a group so special, in fact,
that it is arguably the /raison d'Ãªtre/ for the discipline of Computational
Finance. These are called /financial assets/, and are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_asset][defined as follows]]
(/emphasis ours/):

#+name: definition_2_12
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.12*: A /financial asset/ is a non-physical asset /whose value is
derived from a contractual claim/, such as bank deposits, bonds, and stocks.
Financial assets are /usually more liquid than other tangible assets/, such as
commodities or real estate, and may be traded on financial markets.
#+end_quote

Many points worthy of discussion emanate from this seemingly trivial definition
--- such as /derived/ --- but we must leave them for a more suitable setting, or
else risk entering into too rocky a terrain. For now we shall narrow our focus
to the term /liquidity/. Liquidity is the idea that the process of conversion of
an asset to cash may have a certain amount of "friction" associated with it;
that it may not always be as smooth as one would wish. Having value stored in a
financial asset implies transitioning value into a more /illiquid/ state (/i.e./
further away from cash), and converting value back to cash means having value in
a more /liquid/ state (Figure [[liquidity]]).

The same figure also illustrates the point that some financial assets are more
liquid than others --- that is, more easily convertible back into cash. Note
that cash itself is composed of /currency or currency equivalents/ ([[id:2A81E1EB-2B9F-27B4-93B3-266A634E07B3][Definition
2.8]]), which is to say financial assets that are very liquid such as bank
deposits form part of the accounting definition of cash. Liquidity, in this
sense, is a spectrum of possibilities, and to make matters more complicated, it
is also a dynamic process: as time marches forwards, a financial asset may (or
may not) change its characteristics with regards to liquidity. For example, a
bank under stress may restrict access to its depositors, making deposits less
liquid.

Somewhat confusingly, the idea of liquidity also applies to /entities
themselves/. Wikipedia [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_liquidity][tells us that]] (/emphasis ours/): "[in] accounting,
/liquidity/ (or /accounting liquidity/) is a measure of /the ability of a debtor
to pay their debts as and when they fall due/." These notions are related
because, by definition, an entity in liquidity trouble does not have access to a
"sufficiently large" pool of liquid assets. It is also normally clear what is
meant by the word depending on context, so we need not trouble ourselves with it
any further.

At any rate, thus far we have introduced the concepts of /cash/ and /liquidity/;
the final pillar of this triad is the notion of /cashflow/, which finally starts
to bring the system into motion. It is defined [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow][as follows]] (/emphasis ours/):

#+name: definition_2_13
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.13*: A /cash flow/ is a real or virtual movement of money [...].
[A] cash flow in its narrow sense is /a payment/ (in a currency), especially
from one central bank account to another; the term 'cash flow' is mostly used to
/describe payments that are expected to happen in the future/, are thus
uncertain and therefore need to be forecast with cash flows [...]. [It] is
however popular to use cash flow in a less specified sense describing (symbolic)
/payments into or out of a business, project, or financial product/.
#+end_quote

A cash flow is a vector quantity, where the magnitude is an amount in a given
currency, and the direction indicates whether cash is flowing /out/ of an entity
or /into/ it. The /cash flow sign convention/ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow_sign_convention][stipulates that]] negative values
represent cash /outflows/ and positive values represent cash /inflows/, with
regards to an entity that acts as the reference point. Figure [[cash_flows]] depicts
the relative nature of the direction by means of a payment of =50 BTC= from
=Entity A= to =Entity B=. From =A='s perspective, there is an outflow of =-50
BTC=, whereas =B= sees an inflow of =+50 BTC=.

#+caption: Cash inflows and outflows, relative to an entity.
#+name: cash_flows
#+attr_latex: :width 170pt :height 60pt
[[file:cashflow_inflow_outflow.png]]

The magnitude of a cash flow (=50 BTC= in the example above) is known as the
/notional/ or /principal/, and is defined as follows (/emphasis ours/):

#+name: definition_2_14
#+begin_quote
*Definition 2.14*: The /notional amount/ (or /notional principal amount/ or
/notional value/) on a financial instrument is the /nominal or face amount/ that
is /used to calculate payments made on that instrument/. /This amount generally
does not change/ and is thus referred to as notional.
#+end_quote

It is useful to think of Cash flows as /events/, and thus they are commonly
referred to as /cash flow events/ and modeled as observations or the expectation
of an observation. The temporal aspects are given by an associated /time point/,
which details /when/ the flow occurred --- if in the past --- or is due to occur
--- if in the future. In the example above, the flow occurred at time $t_0$. It
is customary to use the letter $t$ to refer to a time point, with $t_0$ being
typically used to represent an initial or origin time point and subsequent time
points being designated as $t_0, t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n$.

In the example above we dealt with an individual cash flow, but it is an
atypical example manufactured solely to introduce the concept. More often than
not, they will appear in groups --- often quite large ones. Where there are
several /related/ cash flows, is often useful to bundle them together and refer
to them in the aggregate. A group of related cash flows is known as a /cash flow
stream/. In typical usage, the expression /cash flow stream/ often implies the
cash flows are in the future, though it may not always be used with this
meaning. In this text, we take it to mean "a group of related cash flows"
regardless of temporalitiy[fn:leg].

[fn:leg] Depending on the context, a group of cash flows may also be known as a
/leg/. We shall delay the discussion of this term.


Cash flows are one of the most fundamental particles from which financial assets
can be constructed; and, ultimately, all financial assets can be decomposed back
into a stream of cash flows. This property has some very interesting
consequences, as we shall see much later on, since it makes possible the
/replication/ of the behaviour of a given financial asset by assembling, very
carefully, groups of other kinds of financial assets in a such a way as to match
precisely the cash flow streams of the original asset. We are getting ahead of
ourselves, though, and much domain exploration is needed before this topic can
be broached. For now, we shall head back to our excursion over the foundations
for one final round of core concepts.
