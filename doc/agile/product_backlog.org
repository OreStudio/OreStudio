This document contains the [[http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/product-backlog][product backlog]] for VisualOre.

* Product Vision

Here we define what we consider to be the [[http://www.scaledagileframework.com/vision/][the vision]] for the product; what
guides us when we think about the product and what can and cannot go into the
product backlog.

** Vision Statement

The vision for ORE Studio is to build on top of [[https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine][ORE]] with the aim of providing:

- a persistent database storage for all of its inputs and outputs;
- a graphical user interface both for data generation as well as data exploration;
- the ability to configure and orchestrate ORE execution.

** Vision Quotes

#+begin_quote
People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But
that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good
ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the
things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to
1,000 things. -- Steve Jobs

* Release Checklist

Steps to create a new release.

** Close previous sprint

To be done on the last Sunday of the sprint.

1. Make a copy of current sprint backlog and name it current sprint + 1.
2. Move all untouched stories into product backlog.
3. Close current sprint: close all open tasks, delete tasks we did not work on,
   update clocks.
4. Push commit and wait for builds. This ensures that if there are any failures
   you can fix them before the release tag.
4. Tag commit and sign it with key.
5. Push tag. You can generate new builds overnight.
6. When tag build is finished, unpack and copy binaries into release, announce
   twitter and linked in.

** Open new sprint

Note: use Claude to do this via the [[id:C5EEF144-BB9D-2F44-453B-4B7338D8A457][New Sprint Skill]].

1. Open new sprint, updating CMake version, README, GitHub (packages),
   =vcpkg.json=. Build all and run tests. This should all be in one commit.
2. Create a demo. Publish it on youtube.
3. Write up release notes, publish them in github.

* Stories

** Near

Stories we may get two in the next two or three sprints.

*** Add "system" account                                               :code:

Modified by must always map to an existing account. We need to create an account
that cannot login and which is used for all of the initial population.

Publication should be done using the new admin account, not the system account.

*** Create python script to split xsdcpp output                        :code:

We are generating one very large file with all the types. This is not ideal.
Also, this will probably not work for FPML as the schema is even larger.

*** Split create schemas from main populate script                     :code:

We should probably add a create schemas script.

*** Message handlers are not scalable                                  :code:

Claude just mentioned this in passing:

#+begin_quote
Read(projects/ores.dq/src/messaging/dq_message_handler.cpp)
  ⎿  Error: File content (25665 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000). Please use offset and limit parameters to read specific portions of the file, or use the GrepTool to search for specific content.
● Read(projects/ores.dq/src/messaging/dq_message_handler.cpp)
  ⎿  Read 200 lines
#+end_quote

This will not work when we have hundreds of types in a component. We need to
split these files by message type.

*** C++ Complexity Measurements                                        :code:

Since we are no longer taking a close look at the generated code and since
Gemini code review does not catch all issues, we should try to find some
automated tools to measure complexity and point to places where generated code
is not ideal.

*** Generate C++ code for FPML                                         :code:

We need to fix any limitations we may have in xsdcpp.

*** Clicking save on connections causes exit                           :code:

Asks if we want to exit. Also clicking save several times creates folders with
the same name.

*** Analysis on database name service                                  :code:

Is this used? If so, the service should not be connecting to the admin database.

*** External data issues                                               :code:

Problems observed:

- missing =downloaded_at= for a lot of data.
- spurious =manifest.txt=, we should only have =manifest.json=.
- duplication of data in catalog and main manifest. The manifest is the catalog.
  Remove duplication.
- for github downloads, add git commit.
- not clear who "owner" is. It has to map to an account or group in the system.
- datasets have a catalog, but they shoud be forced to use the catalog of the
  manifest:

:             "catalog": "Open Source Risk Engine",

- need a domain for data such as XML Schemas.
- we should ensure the methodology is one of the defined methodologies in the
  file.
- since datasets refer to data in subdirectories, we should add the directory to
  the manifest. Not needed in DB.

*** Check for uses of raw libpq                                        :code:

Claude has the habit of sneaking in uses of raw libpq. We need to do a review of
the code to make sure we are using sqlgen.

Notes:

- check for raw libpq in bitemporal operations.

*** ORE Sample Data                                                    :code:

We added examples and XSDs from ORE. We should consider some improvements to
this dataset:

- remove unnecessary files (notebooks, pngs, pdfs, etc).

*** Make the icon theme "configurable"                                 :code:

While we are trying to find a good icon theme, it should be possible to change
the icons without having to rebuild. Ideally without having to restart, but if
we have to restart that's not too bad.

*** Listener error in comms service                                    :code:

Investigate this:

#+begin_src logview

*** Implement party related entities at database level                 :code:

The first step of this work is to get the entities to work at the database
schema level.

**** Table Structure: party

| Field Name           | Data Type   | Constraints     | Commentary                                                                                        |

*** Add party entity                                                   :code:

Party analysis.

| Field             | Type | Description                                | Foreign Key Reference      |
|-------------------+------+--------------------------------------------+----------------------------|
| party_id          | UUID | Primary key (globally unique identifier)   | —                          |
| full_name         | TEXT | Legal or registered name                   | —                          |
| short code        | TEXT | Short code for the party.                  |                            |
| organization_type | INT  | Type of organization                       | → organization_type_scheme |
| parent_party_id   | INT  | References parent party (self-referencing) | → party_id (nullable)      |

*** Add party identifier entity                                        :code:

Allows a party to have multiple external identifiers (e.g., LEI, BIC).

| Field       | Type | Description                               | Foreign Key Reference |
|-------------+------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------|
| party_id    | UUID | References party.party_id                 | → party               |
| id_value    | TEXT | Identifier value, e.g., "549300..."       | —                     |
| id_scheme   | TEXT | Scheme defining identifier type, e.g. LEI | → party_id_scheme     |
| Description | TEXT | Additional information about the party    |                       |

Primary key: composite (party_id, id_scheme)

*** Contact information entity                                         :code:

Contact Information is a container that groups various ways to reach an entity.

Contact Information can be associated with either a Party (at the legal entity
level) or a BusinessUnit (at the desk/operational level). To build a robust
trading system, your database should support a polymorphic or flexible link to
handle this.

The Logic of the Link:

- Link to Party: Used for Legal and Regulatory contact details. This is the
  "Head Office" address, the legal service of process address, or the general
  firm-wide contact for the LEI.
- Link to Business Unit: Used for Execution and Operational contact details.
  This is where your "Machine" or "Human" actually lives. It links the trader or
  algo to a specific desk's phone number, email, and—most importantly—its
  Business Center (Holiday Calendar).

**** Type: Contact Information

This is the main container for how to reach a party or person.

- address (Complex): The physical location.
- phone (String): Multiple entries allowed (Work, Mobile, Fax).
- email (String): Electronic mail addresses.
- webPage (String): The entity's URL.

**** Type: Address

The physical street address structure.

- streetAddress (Complex): Usually a list of strings (Line 1, Line 2, etc.).
- city (String): The city or municipality.
- state (String): The state, province, or region.
- country (Scheme): An ISO 3166 2-letter country code (e.g., US, GB).
- postalCode (String): The ZIP or Postcode.

*** Add a organisation type scheme entity                              :code:

Indicates a type of organization.

- Obtained on 2016-06-13

- URL: http://www.fpml.org/coding-scheme/organization-type-2-0.xml

- Code: MSP
- Name: Major Swap Participant
- Description: A significant participant in the swaps market, for example as
  defined by the Dodd-Frank Act.

*** Business unit entity                                               :code:

Represents internal organizational units (e.g., desks, departments, branches).
Supports hierarchical structure.

| Field                   | Type | Description                                   | Foreign Key Reference              |

| unit_id                 | INT  | Primary key                                   | —                                  |
| party_id                | UUID | Top-level legal entity this unit belongs to   | → party                            |
| parent_business_unit_id | INT  | References parent unit (self-referencing)     | → business_unit.unit_id (nullable) |
| unit_name               | TEXT | Human-readable name (e.g., "FX Options Desk") | —                                  |
| unit_id_code            | TEXT | Optional internal code or alias               | —                                  |
| business_centre         | TEXT | Business centre for the unit                  | → business centre scheme           |

business_centre may be null (for example, we may want to have global desk and
then London desk.

*** Book and Portfolio entities                                        :code:

Support a single, unified hierarchical tree for risk aggregation and reporting
(Portfolios) while maintaining operational accountability and legal/bookkeeping
boundaries at the leaf level (Books).

**** Portfolio

Logical Aggregation Nodes. Represents organizational, risk, or reporting
groupings. Never holds trades directly.

| Field               | Type      | Description                                                                           |
|---------------------+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| portfolio_id (PK)   | UUID      | Globally unique identifier.                                                           |
| parent_portfolio_id | UUID (FK) | Self-referencing FK. NULL = root node.                                                |
| name                | TEXT      | Human-readable name (e.g., "Global Rates", "APAC Credit").                            |
| owner_unit_id       | INT (FK)  | Business unit (desk/branch) responsible for management.                               |
| purpose_type        | ENUM      | 'Risk', 'Regulatory', 'ClientReporting', 'Internal'.                                  |
| aggregation_ccy     | CHAR(3)   | Currency for P&L/risk aggregation at this node (ISO 4217).                            |
| is_virtual          | BOOLEAN   | If true, node is purely for on-demand reporting (not persisted in trade attribution). |
| created_at          | TIMESTAMP | Audit trail.                                                                          |

Note: Portfolios do not have a legal_entity_id. Legal context is derived from
descendant Books.

**** Book

Operational Ledger Leaves. The only entity that holds trades. Serves as the
basis for accounting, ownership, and regulatory capital treatment.

| Field               | Type      | Description                                                                         |
|---------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| book_id (PK)        | UUID      | Globally unique identifier.                                                         |
| parent_portfolio_id | UUID (FK) | Mandatory: Links to exactly one portfolio.                                          |
| name                | TEXT      | Must be unique within legal entity (e.g., "FXO_EUR_VOL_01").                        |
| legal_entity_id     | UUID (FK) | Mandatory: References party.party_id (must be an LEI-mapped legal entity).          |
| ledger_ccy          | CHAR(3)   | Functional/accounting currency (ISO 4217).                                          |
| gl_account_ref      | TEXT      | Reference to external GL (e.g., "GL-10150-FXO"). May be nullable if not integrated. |
| cost_center         | TEXT      | Internal finance code for P&L attribution.                                          |
| book_status         | ENUM      | 'Active', 'Closed', 'Frozen'.                                                       |
| is_trading_book     | BOOLEAN   | Critical for Basel III/IV: distinguishes Trading vs. Banking Book.                  |
| created_at          | TIMESTAMP | For audit.                                                                          |
| closed_at           | TIMESTAMP | When book_status = 'Closed'.                                                        |

Objectives:

- Strict separation: Portfolios = logical; Books = operational
- Legal ownership at Book level → critical for regulatory capital, legal netting, tax
- Hierarchy via parent_portfolio_id
- Trading vs. Banking book flag → Basel requirement

Hierarchy Integrity Constraints:

- Rule: A Portfolio must not directly contain another Portfolio and a Book at
  the same level if that violates business policy.
  - Enforce via application logic or DB constraint (e.g., CHECK that a Portfolio
    is either "container-only" or "leaf-container", but typically Portfolios can
    contain both sub-Portfolios and Books—this is normal).
- Cycle Prevention: Ensure no circular references (parent → child → parent). Use
  triggers or application validation.

- Multi-Legal Entity Support: Your model allows Books under the same Portfolio
  to belong to different legal entities. Is this intentional?
  - Allowed in some firms (for consolidated risk views).
  - Forbidden in others (e.g., regulatory ring-fencing).
  - Recommendation: Add a validation rule (application-level): If a Portfolio
    contains any Books, all descendant Books must belong to the same
    legal_entity_id.” Or, if mixed entities are allowed, flag the Portfolio as
    'MultiEntity' in purpose_type.

- Trade Ownership: Explicitly state: Every trade must have a book_id (FK). No
  trade exists outside a Book. This is implied but should be documented as a
  core invariant.

- Lifecycle & Governance: Add version or valid_from/valid_to if Books/Portfolios
  evolve over time (e.g., name changes, reorgs).
  - Especially important for audit and historical P&L.

- Consider owner_person_id (trader or book manager) for Books.

- Naming & Uniqueness:
  Enforce: (legal_entity_id, name) must be unique for Books.
  - Prevents ambiguous book names like "RatesDesk" used by two entities.

- Book Closure Policy: When a Book is Closed, should existing trades remain?
  - Yes (typical). But no new trades allowed.
  - Your book_status covers this

Combined Hierarchy Rules (Refined):

| Rule                | Description                                                                                                   |
|---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Leaf Invariant      | Only Books may hold trades. Portfolios are purely aggregators.                                                |
| Single Parent       | Every Book and non-root Portfolio has exactly one parent.                                                     |
| Legal Entity Scope  | A Book declares its legal owner. A Portfolio’s legal scope is the union of its Books’ entities.               |
| Permissioning       | Trade permission → granted on book_id. View/Analyze permission → granted on portfolio_id (includes subtree)   |
| Accounting Boundary | P&L, capital, and ledger entries are computed per Book, then rolled up through Portfolios in aggregation_ccy. |

*** Add business centre scheme entity                                  :code:

The following is the analysis for adding support to party schemes.

Note: add a foreign key to the country table, which may be null in some cases.

The coding-scheme accepts a 4 character code of the real geographical business
calendar location or FpML format of the rate publication calendar. While the 4
character codes of the business calendar location are implicitly locatable and
used for identifying a bad business day for the purpose of payment and rate
calculation day adjustments, the rate publication calendar codes are used in the
context of the fixing day offsets. The 4 character codes are based on the
business calendar location some of which based on the ISO country code or
exchange code, or some other codes. Additional business day calendar location
codes could be built according to the following rules: the first two characters
represent the ISO 3166 country code [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/],
the next two characters represent either a) the first two letters of the
location, if the location name is one word, b) the first letter of the first
word followed by the first letter of the second word, if the location name
consists of at least two words. Note: for creating new city codes for US and
Canada: the two-letter combinations used in postal US states
(http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/28apb.htm ) and Canadian provinces
(http://www.canadapost.ca/tools/pg/manual/PGaddress-e.asp) abbreviations cannot
be utilized (e.g. the code for Denver, United States is USDN and not USDE,
because of the DE is the abbreviation for Delaware state ). Exchange codes could
be added based on the ISO 10383 MIC code
[https://www.iso20022.org/sites/default/files/ISO10383_MIC/ISO10383_MIC.xls]
according to the following rules: 1. it would be the acronym of the MIC. If
acronym is not available, 2. it would be the MIC code. If the MIC code starts
with an 'X', 3. the FpML AWG will compose the code. 'Publication Calendar Day',
per 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions, means, in respect of a
benchmark, any day on which the Administrator is due to publish the rate for
such benchmark pursuant to its publication calendar, as updated from time to
time. FpML format of the rate publication calendar. The construct: CCY-[short
codes to identify the publisher], e.g. GBP-ICESWAP. The FpML XAPWG will compose
the code.

To reproduce, change artefact type in codegen back to "Solvaris Currencies".

*** General session dialog                                             :code:

At present we can't see a dialog with sessions for all users. We need to go to
accounts to see a specific user session. We need to modify this dialog to be
able to show either all sessions or sessions for a specific user.

Notes:

- it should be possible to kick out a user or selection of users.
- it should be possible to send a message to a user or all users.
- session icon is just a circle
- add paging support.

*** Issues with event viewer                                           :code:

- no icon.
- can't filter by event type.
- always collect events in ring buffer. Search for story on this.

*** Add action type to trades                                          :code:

Seems like FPML has some kind of trade activity like actions:

- https://www.fpml.org/coding-scheme/action-type-1-0.xml

*** Improve tag support                                                :code:

At present we are not tagging DQ entities very well. For example, crypto
currencies should be tagged as both crypto and currencies, etc.

Also tags have duplicates, and versioning does not seem to be working:

#+begin_src sql
ores_frosty_leaf=> select * from dq_tags_artefact_tbl;
              dataset_id              |                tag_id                | version |      name      |              description

#+end_src

We need a generic tags table and then a junction between say datasets and tags,
etc. Delete all of the existing half-baked tags implementations. Also have a
look at the story in backlog about tags and labels.

*** Authentication failed dialog does not have details                 :code:

At present we show the C++ exception:

#+begin_quote
Authentication failed: Failed to connect to server: Connection refused [system:111 at /home/marco/Development/OreStudio/OreStudio.local1/build/output/linux-clang-debug/vcpkg_installed/x64-linux/include/boost/asio/detail/reactive_socket_connect_op.hpp:97:37 in function 'static void boost::asio::detail::reactive_socket_connect_op<boost::asio::detail::range_connect_op<boost::asio::ip::tcp, boost::asio::any_io_executor, boost::asio::ip::basic_resolver_results<boost::asio::ip::tcp>, boost::asio::detail::default_connect_condition, boost::asio::detail::awaitable_handler<boost::asio::any_io_executor, boost::system::error_code, boost::asio::ip::basic_endpoint<boost::asio::ip::tcp>>>, boost::asio::any_io_executor>::do_complete(void *, operation *, const boost::system::error_code &, std::size_t) [Handler = boost::asio::detail::range_connect_op<boost::asio::ip::tcp, boost::asio::any_io_executor, boost::asio::ip::basic_resolver_results<boost::asio::ip::tcp>, boost::asio::detail::default_connect_condition, boost::asio::detail::awaitable_handler<boost::asio::any_io_executor, boost::system::error_code, boost::asio::ip::basic_endpoint<boost::asio::ip::tcp>>>, IoExecutor = boost::asio::any_io_executor]']
#+end_quote

Add details button.

*** Ensure DQ dataset checks use code                                  :code:

We are still checking for Name:

#+begin_src sql
    -- Get the flags dataset ID (for linking images)
    select id into v_flags_dataset_id
    from ores.dq_datasets_tbl
    where name = 'Country Flag Images'
      and subject_area_name = 'Country Flags'
      and domain_name = 'Reference Data'
      and valid_to = ores.utility_infinity_timestamp_fn();

    if v_flags_dataset_id is null then
        raise exception 'Dataset not found: Country Flag Images';
    end if;
#+end_src

*** Create subsets of datasets                                         :code:

In some cases we may just want to publish a subset of a dataset. For example,
Majors, G11, etc. Or maybe these are just separate datasets?

In fact that is what they are. Break apart the larger sets - in particular
currencies, countries, cryptos.

*** Management of roles                                                :code:

At present we have system level roles. This is not ideal, you may want to delete
roles, add them etc. Do some analysis on the best way to implement these. We
could have curated datasets for roles as well. Admin is the exception.

Notes:

- should be possible to see which accounts have what roles.

*** Publish history dialog is non-standard                             :code:

- always on top.
- no paging.

*** Add purge button to all entities                                   :code:

We should be able to completely trash all data. We probably need a special
permission for this but admin should be able to do it. Ideally all entity
dialogs should have a purge action.

We should also have a "purge all" button which purges all data from all tables -
ignores roles etc. This could be available on the data librarian.

*** Improve icon for methodology and dimensions                        :code:

At present we have icons which are not very sensible. For methodology we could
use something that reminds one of a laboratory.

*** Clicking on connection should provide info                         :code:

- when never connected: nothing.
- when connected: server, bytes sent, received, status of connection.
- when disconnected: retries, disconnected since.

*** Add coloured icons                                                 :code:

At present we are using black and white icons. These are a bit hard to see. We
should try the coloured ones and see if it improves readability.

*** Add a "is alive" message                                           :code:

We need to brainstorm this. At present we can only tell if a server is there or
not by connecting. It would be nice to give some visual indicator to the user
that the server is not up as soon as the user types the host. this may not be a
good idea.

Notes:

- could tell client if registration / sign-up is supported.

*** Change reason and categories need permissions                      :code:

We need some very specific permissions as these are reg-sensitive.

*** Change reason not requested on delete                              :code:

At present you can delete entities without providing a change reason.

*** Remember dialog sizes and positions                                :code:

At present we need to resize dialogs frequently. We should write this to
QSettings.

*** Accounts need to have a human or robot field                       :code:

Look for correct terminology (actor type?).

*** Geo-location tests fail for some IP Addresses                      :code:

Error is probably happening because the range is not supposed to be used.

We should write the assertions in the logs.


*** Add support for staging                                            :code:

- on import, are we importing one currency at a time? should import the entire
  file.

*** Non-classified observations                                    :analysis:

Observations, snags and so forth that have not been analysed to form a proper
story.

- add configuration option not to confirm on quit.
- no repository tests for change reason. We need to check all entities and the
  coverage.
- qt code processing for network error messages is duplicated.
- raw SQL in image repository, should be a function.
- session should record if telemetry is enabled or not enabled.
- bootstrap mode flag change does not generate new version.
- it is possible to create a country without a name. likely a currency too.
- should be possible to click on user and see user profile details. If the user
  is admin, show all details; if not, show only key ones like email, etc.
- remove maximise button.
- test suites need to log version at the start. info script needs to grep log
  for version for all suites.
- no generators for roles and permissions it seems.
- we still have the legacy password salt field.
- should role permission tables have change reasons?
- missing ores.analyser from system model.
- add flag "is iso compliant" or some such for currencies and countries which
  are in the standard.
- allow users displaying password in password boxes.
- send and receive are empty in sessions.
- next, can you explain the difference in window types between the main currency
  dialog and say currency history and currency details. we switched of minimise
  button on the currency history and currency details and that worked fine. we
  tried switching it off on the main currency window twice and that never seems
  to work. can we make all windows the same type? same as currency history /
  currency details.
- merge common functionality between entities in ores.qt.
- updating email from my account does not raise an event.
- fictional countries should also have X prefixes
- generate button should only exist in new, not edit.
- no save button in currency list, need for generation
- would be nice to be able to "locally modify" entity and then press save for
  the batch. in git we call this staging, what name should we use? and what
  icon?
- server should peridically house keep sessions. if not connected, just mark it
  as orphan. also when connection is dropped mark session as finished.
- shouldn't revert to version be a server side operation? e.g. current version,
  target version.
- in the history diff, add a "from version" combo which shows either latest or
  previous.

*** Add a flag for human readable time                                 :code:

We should be able to use regular timestamps or human readable time.

*** Retrieve NAT'ed IP address from local IP                           :code:

It would be nice to be able to resolve to the NAT'ed IP address. Gemini:

#+begin_src cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <boost/asio.hpp>

using boost::asio::ip::tcp;

std::string get_public_ip() { try { boost::asio::io_context io_context;

    // 1. Resolve the address for api.ipify.org
    tcp::resolver resolver(io_context);
    tcp::resolver::results_type endpoints = resolver.resolve("api.ipify.org", "http");

    // 2. Connect to the server
    tcp::socket socket(io_context);
    boost::asio::connect(socket, endpoints);

    // 3. Formulate the HTTP GET request
    std::string request =
        "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        "Host: api.ipify.org\r\n"
        "Connection: close\r\n\r\n";

    // 4. Send the request
    boost::asio::write(socket, boost::asio::buffer(request));

    // 5. Read the response
    boost::asio::streambuf response;
    boost::asio::read_until(socket, response, "\r\n");

    // Check the status line (optional but recommended)
    std::istream response_stream(&response);
    std::string http_version;
    unsigned int status_code;
    response_stream >> http_version >> status_code;

    if (status_code != 200) {
        return "Error: HTTP Status " + std::to_string(status_code);
    }

    // Skip the HTTP headers
    boost::asio::read_until(socket, response, "\r\n\r\n");

    // The remaining data in the buffer (and what's left to read) is the IP
    std::string public_ip;
    while (boost::asio::read(socket, response, boost::asio::transfer_at_least(1), boost::system::error_code())) {
        // Keep reading until EOF
    }

    // Convert the body content to a string
    std::stringstream ss;
    ss << &response;
    public_ip = ss.str();

    // api.ipify.org returns only the IP as plain text in the body
    return public_ip;

} catch (std::exception& e) {
    return std::string("Exception: ") + e.what();
}
}

int main() {
        stdout::cout << "Fetching public IP..." << std::endl;
        std::string ip = get_public_ip();
        std::cout << "Your Public IP is: " << ip << std::endl;
        return 0;
}
#+end_src


*** Users should be able to add picture to profile                     :code:

It would be useful to have avatars. We can then display those in other places.

*** Add support for protocol debugging in Qt                           :code:

We should add a view of all messages sent and received like the comms champ
tools. It should be possible to record a session to file (maybe all the
requests?) and then replay that session. You should be able to do it from the
UI.

Links:

- [[https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt][GH: cc_tools_qt]]: "This project contains tool application(s), which can be used
  to develop, monitor and debug custom binary communication protocols, that were
  developed using the COMMS Library. All the applications are plug-in based,
  i.e. plug-ins are used to define I/O socket, data filters, and the custom
  protocol itself. The tools use Qt framework for GUI interfaces as well as
  loading and managing plug-ins."
- [[https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt/wiki/How-to-Use-CommsChampion-Tools][How to Use CommsChampion Tools]]: screenshots of the UI to explore the protocol.

*** Assorted UI polish work                                            :code:

Break these down into their own stories:

- icons for CRUD are not enabling when on detached mode.
- no status bar in dettached mode.
- should we just have toolbars at the detached window level?
- application should exit when main window is closed.
- is it possible to dock windows like visual studio?
- add a detach current window that just detaches that window.
- disabled menu options are not properly greyed out. Done.

*** Instrument components with telemetry context                       :code:

Now that logging has been integrated with telemetry, the next step is to
instrument key components with the =TLOG_SEV= macro to enable trace correlation.

Tasks:

- Instrument =server_session= with root span on connection, child spans per
  request.
- Instrument =client_session= with spans for outgoing requests.
- Pass =telemetry_context= through message handlers in ores.iam, ores.refdata, etc.
- Add spans for database operations in ores.database.




*** Add modified since for all entities                                :code:

We added support for this only for images. We need to update all types such as
currencies etc with support for point in time gets.

*** Add widget to manage assets                                        :code:

We can't upload flags etc.

Merged stories:

*Add an image browser*

At present we can't add or remove images.

- update existing image browser to show tags and allow switching them on and
  off.

*** Missing session properties                                         :code:

- disconnect type: orphaned, client disconnect.
- add version, commit, etc.

*** Update currency details to use tabs                                :code:

We need a main tab with the currency related properties, then a "system" tab
with temporal data which is read-only even on edit and a "image" tab with the
image used to represent the currency. It could also contain some description or
notes.


*** Locking an account should log user out                             :code:

At present if you lock an account the user will remain logged in.

*** Review of Wt                                                       :code:

Problems:

- no icons in website for the tab.
- no flags in currencies in wt.
- no way of knowing about reload (eventing) in wt. we should make the reload
  button change colour?
- currency edit window in wt is too large, can't see bottom of screen.
- cannot edit account in wt.
- iso code field too small, numeric code field too small
- adding new account crashes wt. saving new currency crashes wt.

*** Add a dashboard for users                                          :code:

As per screenshots:

[[./user_dashboard_core_ui.png]]

[[./dashboard_ideas.png]]

[[./dashboard_ideas_II.png]]

Notes:

- add command to shell to list sessions.

*** Add sign-up approval workflow                                      :code:

Should also handle invite codes, etc.

We did most of the work except invite codes.

*** Listen for events in details dialog                                :code:

At present we are only listening for details in the main dialogs (accounts,
currencies). It would be nice to be able to listen to events in the details
dialogs. however, it needs to listen to events only for that specific entity
(e.g. currency pair, account etc). Not sure we are setup for this.


*** Review skills in claude code templates                             :code:

#+begin_quote
Ready-to-use configurations for Anthropic's Claude Code. A comprehensive
collection of AI agents, custom commands, settings, hooks, external integrations
(MCPs), and project templates to enhance your development workflow.
#+end_quote

*** Add claude continuous learning skill                               :code:

#+begin_quote
Every time you use an AI coding agent, it starts from zero. You spend an hour
debugging some obscure error, the agent figures it out, session ends. Next time
you hit the same issue? Another hour.

This skill fixes that. When Claude Code discovers something non-obvious (a
debugging technique, a workaround, some project-specific pattern), it saves that
knowledge as a new skill. Next time a similar problem comes up, the skill gets
loaded automatically.
#+end_quote

*** Add a system clock                                                 :code:

At present we are using "now". We should have a ores function for this so that
we can time travel if required.

*** Implement entity history in shell                                  :code:

We need to add a command in shell to show entity history.

Notes:

- for the history diff we could use a simple unified diff format.

*** Consider adding an "entity waterfall"                              :code:

It would be nice to be able to see what entities have been added, deleted,
modified, etc. This would work as a running commentary.

*** Notification of deletes                                            :code:

At present it is easy to see new rows or modified rows in an entity dialog. It
is not possible to see deleted rows. One way to do this is to preserve state
from before reload by key. Any entities which are not present after reload can
be shown as red. History then allows users to re-instate deleted entities.

*** Add REPL to Qt                                                     :code:

Users should be able to interact with the system directly via the REPL. Add a
simple widget for this.

*** Add entity messages should not set modified by                     :code:

At present you can supply any modified by you want in the protocol messages. It
makes more sense to say the message must have the modified by as the user logged
in from the session.

*** Add heat map of user sessions                                      :code:

Things to measure:

- duration of sessions (once we have session table).
- bytes sent/received per session (possibly 3-D plot?). Also good for anomaly
  detection.
- mine github for ideas.

*** Add currencies update command to shell                             :code:

At present we can only add new currencies. We also need to be able to update.
Also, adding currencies requires supplying all parameters.

*** Subscribe on reconnect fails                                       :code:

Also, we need a login timestamp and a logout timestamp so we can measure session
duration.

*** Currencies displays when not connected                             :code:

At present we can display currencies even before we connect. This is probably ok
but we should at least state we are not connected. Alternatively it should be
disabled.

*** Add a delete all button which deletes all currencies               :code:

It is useful especially in test environments to be able to delete all entities
before a re-import.

Notes:

- purge button.


*** Add party role scheme entity                                       :code:

The following is the analysis for adding support to party schemes.

Contains a code representing a related party role. This can be extended to
provide custom roles.

- Obtained on 2025-11-10.
- Version 4-1.
- URL: http://www.fpml.org/coding-scheme/party-role-4-1.xml

Code

- Description: Organization responsible for preparing the accounting for the
  trade.

- Code: Allocation
- Description: Agent The organization responsible for supplying the allocations
  for a trade to be allocated to multiple accounts/organizations.

- Description: Broker The organization that arranged the trade, i.e. brought
  together the counterparties. Synonyms/Alternatives: Inter-dealer broker,
  agent.

- Code: Beneficiary
- Description: Organization that suffers the economic benefit of the trade. The
  beneficiary may be distinct from the principal/counterparty - an example
  occurs when a hedge fund trades via a prime broker; in this case the principal
  is the prime broker, but the beneficiary is the hedge fund. This can be
  represented as a payer/receiver account in the name of the hedge fund, but it
  is also possible to add the party role of "Beneficiary" at the
  partyTradeInformation level.

- Code: Booking
- Description: Party The entity for which the organization supporting the
  trade's processing has booked/recorded the trade. This is used in
  non-reporting workflows situations in which the trade doesn't need to be
  reported but a firm still wants to specify their own side.

- Code: Buyer
- Description: Acquirer of the legal title to the financial instrument. In the
  case of an option, the buyer is the holder of the option. In the case of a
  swap or forward, the buyer will be determined by industry best practice. This
  does not refer to an investor or investment manager or other organization on
  what is typically called the "Buy side"; for that, see the "Client" role.
  Corresponds to "Buyer" as defined in certain regulations such as ESMA MiFID
  II/MIFIR RTS 22 field 9.

- Code: Buyer
- Description: DecisionMaker The party or person who, having legal authority to
  act on behalf of the trade counterparty acting as Buyer as defined in this
  coding scheme, made the decision to acquire the financial instrument.
  Corresponds to "buyer decision maker" as defined in ESMA's MIFIR RTS 23
  report. This does not refer to the decision maker for what is traditionally
  called the "Buy side"; for that, see the "Client Decision Maker" role.

- Code: Clearing
- Description: Client An organization that clears trades through a clearing
  house, via a clearing broker (member of the clearing house) who acts as an
  agent on its behalf. The term "client" refers to the organization's role in
  the clearing process in relation to its clearing broker, and not whether it is
  a price maker or taker in the execution process.

- Code: Clearing
- Description: ExceptionParty A party to the trade that claims a clearing
  exception, such as an end-user exception under Dodd-Frank Act provisions.

- Code: Clearing
- Description: Firm Organization that submits the trade to a clearing house on
  behalf of the principal. Synonyms/alternates: Futures Commission Merchant
  (FCM), Clearing Broker, Clearing Member Firm. Some implementations use
  "Clearing Broker" as synonym.

- Description: Organization The organization that acts as a central counterparty
  to clear a derivatives contract. This is used to represent the role of Central
  Counterparties (CCPs) or Derivative Clearing Organizations (DCOs). Sometimes
  called "ClearingService". Some implementations also use the term "Clearer".

  act on behalf of a trade counterparty, made the decision to acquire or sell
  the financial instrument.

- Code: Confirmation
- Description: Platform Organization serving as a financial intermediary for the
  purposes of electronic confirmation or providing services for post-processing
  of transactional data.

- Code: Contractual
- Description: Party A party to a contractual document. If the intended usage
  relates to the context of the trade lifecycle, more specific annotations have
  been defined which might be more appropriate.

- Code: Counterparty
- Description: An economic counterparty to the trade. Synonym: principal.

- Code: Counter
- Description: PartyAffiliate Organization offiially attached to the
  counterparty. e.g. partner, branch, subsidiary.

- Code: Counter
- Description: PartyUltimateParent The topmost entity or organization, within
  the corporate hierarchy, responsible for the reporting party.

- Code: Credit
- Description: SupportProvider Organization that enhances the credit of another
  organization (similar to guarantor, but may not fully guarantee the
  obligation).

- Code: Custodian
- Description: Organization that maintains custody of the asset represented by
  the trade on behalf of the owner/principal.

- Code: Data
- Description: Submitter Entity submitting the transaction report to the
  competent authority.

- Code: Disputing
- Description: Party Organization that is disputing the trade or transaction.

- Code: Document
- Description: Repository A marketplace organization which purpose is to
  maintain document records. If the intended usage relates to the context of the
  trade lifecycle, more specific annotations have been defined which might be
  more appropriate.

- Code: Executing
- Description: Broker The (generally sell-side) organization that executed the
  trade; the price-making party.

- Code: Executing
- Description: Entity Entity executing the transaction. If the transaction is
  executed directly by the reporting party, it will be the reporting party. If
  it is executed by an execution agent or an affiliated party on behalf of the
  reporting party, it will be that affiliate or agent.

- Code: Execution
- Description: Agent The (generally buy-side) organization that acts to execute
  trades on behalf of an investor. Typically this is an investment manager or
  asset manager, and also makes the investment decisions for the investor. If
  required, a separate InvestmentDecision role can be specified to distinguish
  that the party making the investment decision is different.

- Code: Execution
- Description: Facility The facility, exchange, or market where the trade was
  executed. Synonym: Swap Execution Facility, Designated Contract Market,
  Execution Venue.

- Code: Guarantor
- Description: Organization that backs (guarantees) the credit risk of the
  trade.

- Code: Margin
- Description: Affiliate Margin affiliate as defined by U.S. margin and capital
  rules §23.151.

  data service, or exchange/facility/venue data distribution service) that
  published the report of this trade.

- Code: Reporting
- Description: Party The party with the regulatory responsibility to report this
  trade.

- Description: PartyUltimateParent The topmost entity or organization, within
  the corporate hierarchy, responsible for the reporting party.

- Code: Seller
- Description: A counterparty in a trade, which performs in one of the following
  capacities: 1) it transfers or agrees to transfer in the future an instrument
  or title to that instrument in exchange for payment, 2) it writes a
  derivatives instrument such as an option or a swap in which it provides risk
  protection to the buyer. This does not refer to the broker/dealer or other
  organization on what is typically called the "Sell side"; for that, see the
  "Executing Broker" role. Corresponds to "Seller" as defined in certain
  regulations such as ESMA MiFID II/MIFIR RTS 22 field 16.

- Code: Seller
- Description: DecisionMaker The party or person who, having legal authority to
  act on behalf of the trade counterparty acting as Seller as defined in this
  coding scheme, made the decision to sell the financial instrument. Corresponds
  to "seller decision maker" as defined in ESMA's MIFIR RTS 23 report. This does

  used for static reference data, not individual transactions.

*** Modes of operation                                                 :code:

We need to discuss this with Lau. Intuitively it seems that different users have
different "views" on the functions of the system. If you are operations you
probably want a specific set of screens and icons on the toolbar to go with it.
Trading will have a different set. The administrator of the system also, and so
on. There should be a way to create "profiles" which change the toolbar. These
are distinct from user profiles which remember which screens to open and their
positions.

*** Make bootstrap operation atomic using SQL transactions             :code:

The bootstrap operation is currently not atomic. If an exception is thrown after
the admin account is created but before the bootstrap mode feature flag is
disabled, the system is left in an inconsistent state where:

- An admin account exists in the database.
- Bootstrap mode is still enabled (allowing creation of additional admin
  accounts).

**** Current Flow

The bootstrap process in =bootstrap_service.cpp= performs these operations:

1. Create account via =account_service=.
2. Create login_info via =login_info_service=.
3. Assign admin role via =authorization_service=.
4. Disable bootstrap mode via =system_flags_service=.

Each operation auto-commits independently, creating windows for partial failures.

**** Solution

Use sqlgen's =Transaction= class to wrap all bootstrap operations in a single
database transaction. The class provides RAII semantics with automatic rollback
on destructor if =commit()= was not called.

#+begin_src c++
// sqlgen's Transaction class pattern:
~Transaction() {
    if (!transaction_ended_) {
        rollback();  // Auto-rollback on exception
    }
}
#+end_src

**** Challenges

- Current architecture creates separate =database::context= connections per
  service.
- Need to pass a shared connection/transaction across services.
- May require refactoring services to accept an optional transaction parameter.

**** Mitigation

The existing self-healing mechanism in
=bootstrap_mode_service::initialize_bootstrap_state()= detects when bootstrap
mode was not properly disabled after account creation and auto-corrects the
state on server startup. This provides defence in depth but is not a substitute
for proper transactional integrity.

**** Acceptance Criteria

- Bootstrap operation completes fully or rolls back entirely.
- No partial state if any step fails.
- Self-healing mechanism remains as defence in depth.

*** Sign-up dialog should be disabled if feature is disabled           :code:

At present you can click on sign up and fill in all details but then you get a
server error:

#+begin_src logview
2025-12-24 10:46:48.212905 [DEBUG] [ores.iam.messaging.accounts_message_handler] Request: signup_request{username=newuser4, email=newuser4@example.com}

#+end_src

Makes more sense for sign-up button to also be disabled in client. Trouble is,
we do not know as we are not connected. This means the handshake has to provide
some kind of flag saying sign-up is enabled or disabled.

*** Tests are logging to stdout in github                              :code:

There is a lot of stdout output in CDash. We need to understand why that is.

*** User interface options                                             :code:

This story keeps track of configuration points in the UI which should be added
at some point:

- display time in human readable form - e.g. last month, 3 months ago, etc.
- auto-reload. If a dialog receives new data, reload it automatically. Defaults
  to off.

Notes:

- we need a UI to manage the UI options.
- should be stored in the server and cached locally with a sqlite db.

*** New feature flags                                                  :code:

- allow sign-ups. If true, users can create their own accounts. Done.
- auto-authorise sign-ups. If true, the account is automatically created. If
  false, admin user has to authorise it.

Notes:

- we need a UI to manage the UI options.

*** Perform tests to check database connectivity                       :code:

We added some basic database monitoring but did not perform a lot of testing.

We should also generalise this so that if the database goes down after start we
still perform some kind of retry logic.

See also this point from Gemini:

#+begin_quote
The new broadcast_all method appears to be unused in this pull request. The
database status broadcast is implemented directly in
=ores::comms::net::server::broadcast_database_status= without using the
subscription_manager. If this method is not intended for future use, it could be
removed to avoid dead code.
#+end_quote

*** Add sound assets                                                   :code:

We need to be able to associate sounds to certain events such as disconnect,
connect etc. Users need to be able to choose their own sounds.

*** Cli clean-ups                                                      :code:

- we still seem to support =--entity currencies=. This should now be invalid.
  Done.
- we are still exporting as JSON. We should instead allow CSV and XML exports
  only.
- add recipes for all commands.
- should be able to list all admin accounts.
- list command should support table output.
- is admin should be a bool: =--is-admin arg (=0)=
- add account duplicates logic. We should have a single service for this.
- split application into entities.

*** Add search to currencies                                           :code:

It should be possible to filter the open currencies by a string. This should be
any field. The user needs to know when the list has been filtered. Ideally we
should have buttons at the top per field and filter using those. It should go
back to database rather than just filter what is available in UI.

*** Add support for FIX                                                :code:

Links:

- [[https://github.com/jamesdbrock/hffix][GH: hffix]]: "The High Frequency FIX Parser library is an open source
  implementation of tagvalue FIX (classic FIX) intended for use by developers of
  high frequency, low latency financial software. The purpose of the library is
  to do fast, efficient encoding and decoding of FIX in place, at the location
  of the I/O buffer. The library does not use intermediate message objects, and
  it does no memory allocation on the free store (the “heap”)."

*** Consider adding "global search" via typesense                      :code:

Typesense:

#+begin_quote
Typesense is a fast, typo-tolerant search engine for building delightful search
experiences.
#+end_quote

We could pump specially crafted documents into typesense with IDs and types and
then let users search across any type of entity.


Links:

- [[https://github.com/typesense/typesense][GH typesense]]
- [[https://github.com/timescale/pg_textsearch][GH pg_textsearch]]: Modern ranked text search for Postgres.
  - Simple syntax: ORDER BY content <@> 'search terms'
  - BM25 ranking with configurable parameters (k1, b)
  - Works with Postgres text search configurations (english, french, german, etc.)
  - Supports partitioned tables
  - Goal: state-of-the-art performance and scalability

*** Add a generic tagging system                                       :code:

It should be possible to associate any entity with one or more tags and then do
a search by tags on that entity type. For example, tag a set of currencies as
emerging markets and then search by that.

Merged stories:

*Currencies should have tags*

Examples:

- metals, emerging markets
- continent as a tag
- crypto

At present we are overloading the currency type field.

**** Analysis Labels versus tags

#+begin_src markdown
That is an **excellent question** that gets to the heart of cloud governance and
system design. You are correct that the underlying structure is fundamentally
the same—a **key-value pair attached to a resource**—but the distinction is
necessary because of the **context, governance, and enforcement mechanisms**
applied to each one.

The distinction between GCP Labels and Tags boils down to **Annotation vs.
Policy**.

---

## ⚖️ Why the Distinction is Necessary

| Feature              | GCP **Labels** (Annotation)                                                                          | GCP **Tags** (Policy/Governance)                                                                                                                                               |
|:---------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Goal**     | **Organization, filtering, cost allocation, and reporting.**                                         | **Policy enforcement, access control, and hierarchical governance.**                                                                                                           |
| **Structure**        | **Flexible/Arbitrary.** Key-Value pair set directly on the resource.                                 | **Structured/Centralized.** Key and Value are defined *centrally* as separate resources (at the Organization/Project level) and then *bound* to the resource.                  |
| **Hierarchy**        | **Flat.** A resource does not inherit labels from its parent folder.                                 | **Hierarchical.** Tags are inherited by child resources (like a VM inheriting a tag from its containing project).                                                              |
| **Access Control**   | **Low Control.** Any user with permissions to modify the resource can typically modify its labels.   | **High Control.** Dedicated **IAM Roles** are required to create, manage, and even attach Tag Keys and Values. This prevents users from "tagging" their way out of a policy.   |
| **Enforcement**      | **None.** Labels are metadata and cannot be used directly in IAM conditions to grant or deny access. | **High.** Tags are the *only* mechanism designed for **conditional IAM policies** and Organization Policies (e.g., "deny deletion unless resource has tag `environment:dev`"). |
| **Use Case Example** | Filtering the console: "Show me all resources labeled `owner:john_doe`."                             | Security: "Only allow network traffic from resources tagged `security_zone:trusted`."                                                                                          |

### Analogy: The Whiteboard vs. The Building Code

1.  **Labels are like a sticky note on a whiteboard:**
    ,* They are **flexible**, quickly written, and easy to change.
    ,* They are used for **informal organization** (cost center, app name, etc.).
    ,* Changing the note has **no impact on the resource's function** or security.

2.  **Tags are like a building code requirement:**
    ,* They are **highly structured** and defined by a central authority (the city/organization).
    ,* They are used to **enforce policy** (safety, compliance).
    ,* If a resource (a building) doesn't have the correct tag (e.g., a **fire-rating tag**), an automated system (the policy engine) will **deny an action** (e.g., deny occupation or modification).

## How This Relates to Your SVG System

Your current **three-table model** is structurally a **GCP Label** system—it's
excellent for annotation and filtering (e.g., "Give me all icons with the tag
'currency'").

If you wanted to implement a **GCP Tag** concept, you would need to:

1.  **Formalize the Tags:** Create certain tags as *official resources* (like
    `Status` with official values `Draft`, `Approved`, `Production`).
2.  **Add Permissions:** Implement **application logic** that checks a user's
    role against the tag. For example: "A user needs the `Approver` role to
    apply the `Status:Production` tag to an icon."

The need to distinguish them comes down to providing one system that is
,**flexible for organization (Labels)** and another that is **rigid for security
and compliance (Tags)**.

Examples:

- majors, minors, EM, latam, etc are tags we can have on currencies. On currency
  pairs, We could also have USD crosses, which is inferred by having USD as one
  of the pair. However these are not labels because we do not want everyone to
  start using them. When defining a report, you could associate currencies and
  currency pairs to the report via the tags.
- labels are things we could associate with images for example. Flags could have
  both "countries" and "currencies" labels so that when we want to select a flag
  as the image for a currency, we could ask for all images labelled
  "currencies". The labelling can be done by pretty much anyone.

sqlgen.

*** Missing shell functionality                                        :code:

The job of the client is to exercise the entirety of the comms protocol, and to
provide a way to perform CRUD operations via command line. Note:

- client never access the repositories directly, it should do exactly the same as the qt client
  would do.
- client's only interface is the REPL.
- client will eventually be used by AI agents.

Client needs to have messages at the entity level:

- currencies:
  - import currencies from ORE Format. Given a path in the filesystem, it
    performs the import using the importer and appropriate comms messages.
  - export currencies to ORE format. Uses comms to obtain the currencies, then
    the exporter to convert, then dumps them into the terminal as ORE XML.
  - list existing currencies as a table or as JSON. We need support for latest,
    "at time point" and "all" (meaning every single version). It should be
    possible to supply some filtering by the entity's ID (e.g.
    =--iso-code=).
  - delete one or more currencies. User supplies a number of entity IDs (e.g.
    =--iso-code ABC --iso-code CDE --iso-code FGH= and so on).
  - add a currency supplying arguments (e.g. =--iso-code= and so forth).
  - add currencies from JSON.
- accounts:
  - list existing currencies as a table or as JSON. We need support for latest,
    "at time point" and "all" (meaning every single version). It should be
    possible to supply filtering by the entity's ID.
  - delete one or more accounts. User supplies a list of entity IDs.
  - add an account supplying arguments.
  - add accounts from JSON.
- feature flags:
  - list existing feature flags as a table or as JSON. We need support for
    latest, "at time point" and "all" (meaning every single version). It should
    be possible to supply some filtering by the entity's ID
  - delete one or more feature flags. User supplies a list of entity IDs.
  - add feature flags supplying arguments.
  - add feature flags from JSON.

Notes:

- update recipes with the new client commands.

*** Invalid password should not throw                                  :code:

At present in the unlock test we have:

#+begin_src c++
    BOOST_LOG_SEV(lg, info) << "Locking account by failing 5 login attempts";
    auto ip = internet::ipv4();
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        try {
            sut.login(account.username, "wrong_password", ip);
        } catch (...) {}
    }

This is very suspicious; a failed login should just return false or the modern
c++ equivalent (=std::expected=?).

*** Improve handling of error responses                                :code:

As per Gemini code review:

#+begin_src markdown
Certainly. Point #2 from the review of `CurrencyHistoryDialog.cpp` addressed
the potential complexity of error checking by suggesting that relying on the
specific response message type is **fragile**.

The goal is to move from:

1.  Client sends **Request A**.
2.  Server returns **Response A** (Success) OR **Error Response** (Failure) OR
    ,**Response B** (Unexpected success type).
3.  Client checks: *Is the message type exactly **Response A**?*

to a more robust pattern where the client checks for a generic failure response
first.

-----

## 🐞 Fragile Error Check (Current Code)

The current code in `loadHistory` checks for success by expecting *only* the
specific success message type:

```cpp
// Current Fragile Logic
if (result->header().type != comms::protocol::message_type::get_currency_history_response) {
    onHistoryLoadError(QString("Server does not support currency history (received message type %1)")
        .arg(static_cast<int>(result->header().type)));
    return;
}
```

This logic has two main problems:

1.  **Hiding Server Errors:** If the server returns a generic protocol error
    (`message_type::error_response`) because, for example, the client's session
    timed out, the client logs a misleading message: "Server does not support
    currency history." It should be reporting the actual error message sent by
    the server.
2.  **Lack of Standardization:** Every client method needs to implement its own
    logic to handle unexpected types.

-----

## 🛠️ Suggested Improvement: Standardized Error Handling

The improvement is to check for a generic **`error_response`** message type
first, and report its payload/message, before attempting to deserialize the
successful response.

Assuming your system has a standard `error_response` message:

```cpp
void CurrencyHistoryDialog::handleHistoryResponse(const HistoryResult& result) {
    if (!result) {
        onHistoryLoadError(QString::fromStdString(result.error()));
        return;
    }

    // 1. Check for a generic server-side error response
    if (result->header().type == comms::protocol::message_type::error_response) {
        // Assume error_response contains a readable message payload
        auto error_response = risk::messaging::error_response::deserialize(result->payload());
        if (error_response) {
            onHistoryLoadError(QString::fromStdString(error_response->message));
        } else {
            onHistoryLoadError("Server returned a malformed error response.");
        }
        return;
    }

    // 2. Check for the specific SUCCESS response type
    if (result->header().type == comms::protocol::message_type::get_currency_history_response) {
        auto response = risk::messaging::get_currency_history_response::deserialize(result->payload());

        if (!response || !response->success) {
            // Handle success=false within the expected response type
            onHistoryLoadError(QString::fromStdString(response ? response->message : "Invalid or failed history response."));
            return;
        }

        history_ = std::move(response->history);
        onHistoryLoaded();
        return;
    }

    // 3. Handle truly unexpected message type
    onHistoryLoadError(QString("Received unexpected message type %1 from server.")
        .arg(static_cast<int>(result->header().type)));
}
```

By standardizing the **`error_response`** type, the client can always extract
and display the relevant server-side failure reason, leading to much clearer
logging and user feedback.

*** Do not disable cert verification                                   :code:

At present we've hacked cert verify to false. We should not do this. Gemini:

#+begin_quote
You cannot use Let's Encrypt for development purposes because it requires a
public domain name that Let's Encrypt can verify, and your local development
server is not publicly accessible. The recommended approach is to create a local
certificate authority (CA) using a tool like mkcert to sign your certificates,
which allows you to bypass browser warnings for local domains like localhost.

Option 1: Use mkcert for local development

- Install mkcert: Follow the instructions to install the mkcert tool on your
  system.
- Install the local CA: Run the command to install the local CA root certificate
  into your system's trust store. This is a one-time setup.
- Generate a local certificate: Use mkcert to generate certificates for your
  local development domains (e.g., localhost, my-app.local). The generated
  certificates will be signed by your trusted local CA and will not cause
  browser warnings.

Option 2: Use Let's Encrypt with a real public domain

Purchase a domain: Buy a public domain name (e.g., mydomain.dev).

- Use an ACME client: Use an ACME client like Certbot to automate the
  certificate process. You can run certbot on a server that is accessible to the
  public internet.
- Complete the validation: The client will need to verify your ownership of the
  domain through a DNS or HTTP challenge, which requires the domain to be
  publicly reachable.
- Deploy the certificate: Let's Encrypt will issue a certificate that you can
  then deploy to your development server.

Why Let's Encrypt doesn't work for local development

- Let's Encrypt's primary purpose is to secure public-facing websites by
  automatically verifying domain ownership.
- They use ACME protocol challenges (DNS or HTTP) that require the public
  internet to access your server at the specified domain.
- Since your local server is not on the public internet, it cannot respond to
  these challenges, and Let's Encrypt cannot verify your ownership of the
  domain.

Analysis from Gemini:

#+begin_src markdown
To make your Qt application look like an advanced trading system—even for a
simple CRUD operation screen—requires moving beyond basic desktop application
styles toward the dense, high-contrast, data-rich aesthetic of platforms like
Bloomberg or professional broker terminals.

The current look (a dark table with simple data rows) is a great foundation.
Here are targeted suggestions for your Qt UI to elevate it to a professional,
advanced trading system aesthetic:

## I. Color and Contrast (The Dark Theme)

Your current dark gray background is good, but trading systems use specific
contrast to highlight data significance.

1.  **Define a Palette:** Adopt a limited, functional color palette:

      ,* **Primary Background:** A very dark, near-black charcoal (`#1A1A1A` or
        `#1E1E1E`). This is the foundation.
      ,* **Foreground/Text:** Clean white or light gray (`#F0F0F0`).
      ,* **Accent Color (Neutral):** A subdued corporate blue/cyan (`#007ACC` or
        a subtle green/gold from your branding) for selected rows, borders, and
        input focus.
      ,* **Data Status Colors:**
          ,* **Positive (Gains):** Bright, high-contrast green (`#00C853`).
          ,* **Negative (Losses):** High-contrast red (`#FF3333`).
          ,* *(While CRUD isn't about gains/losses, you can use these colors for
            status, like 'Active' vs. 'Inactive' currencies).*

2.  **Subtle Depth:** Avoid flat black. Use a slightly lighter shade of gray
    (`#2A2A2A`) for embedded panels, sidebars, and control areas to create
    visual segmentation, giving the impression of modularity.

## II. Typography and Data Presentation

Trading UIs prioritize density and scannability.

1.  **Monospace Font:** For the currency codes and numerical columns, switch to
    a clear, legible **monospace font** (like Consolas, Fira Code, or a custom
    font in Qt). Monospace fonts ensure that all numbers align perfectly in
    columns, which is essential for rapid data comparison.
2.  **Font Sizing:** Use a small, consistent font size (e.g., 10pt or 11pt) to
    fit more data on screen. Use bolding sparingly, primarily for the Currency
    Code (e.g., USD, EUR).
3.  **Visual Alignment:**
      ,* **Text Columns** (Currency Name): Left-aligned.
      ,* **Code Columns** (ISO Code, Symbol): Center-aligned.
      ,* **Numerical Columns** (Rounding, Precision): Right-aligned. **This is
        critical** for financial UIs, as it allows users to compare magnitude
        instantly.

## III. Advanced Table View Enhancements (QTableView/QTableWidget)

Since the core of this screen is a table, focus on making the table look
high-tech.

1.  **Header Styling:**

      ,* Make column headers slightly stand out with a subtle dark gradient or a
        distinct, slightly brighter background color (e.g., `#282828`).
      ,* Ensure the header font is crisp (perhaps slightly bolder than the row
        data).
      ,* Add tiny, clear **sort indicators** to show the current sort direction.

2.  **Row Selection:**

      ,* The selected row should use your accent color (e.g., a thin blue left
        border or a light blue background fill) with white or light gray text
        for high visibility.
      ,* Introduce **subtle, faint horizontal rules** (1px in a color like
        `#333333`) to separate rows, which aids readability in dense tables.

3.  **Interactive Elements (Hover):** Implement a very subtle change on row
    hover (e.g., the background darkens by 5%) to indicate interactivity, even
    if clicking doesn't change the view.

## IV. UI Layout and Modularity

Advanced UIs are rarely monolithic; they are built from modular panels.

1.  **Toolbar (Top):** Create a clean, dedicated toolbar area at the top for
    your CRUD operations (`Add`, `Edit`, `Delete`) and your system icons
    (Connection, Reference Data).

      ,* Use the Fluent UI System Icons you researched (`globe-32-regular`,
        `money-32-regular`).
      ,* Buttons should be flat, high-contrast text or icons only. On hover, they
        should reveal a subtle gray background or a thin accent border.

2.  **Side Panel (Right or Left):** Instead of a simple dialog for *editing*,
    use a dedicated side panel that slides out or appears next to the table when
    a row is selected.

      ,* This panel would house the detail view for the selected currency. This
        makes the UI feel like a single workspace rather than navigating modal
        windows.
      ,* Give this panel a slightly different background shade (`#2A2A2A`).

3.  **Status Bar (Bottom):** Add a sleek, minimal status bar at the bottom. This
    is where you would place your connection status icon (using your proposed
    `globe-32-regular` or `plug-connected-32-regular` icon). It reinforces the
    "system is live" feel.

## V. Qt-Specific Implementation via Stylesheets

In Qt, you achieve this professional look primarily through **QSS (Qt Style
Sheets)**. You will be targeting specific widgets (like `QTableView`,
`QPushButton`, `QLineEdit`) with CSS-like rules.

```css
/* Example QSS Snippets for the Trading Look */

QTableView {
    /* Base style for the data area */
    background-color: #1A1A1A; /* Primary Background */
    gridline-color: #333333; /* Faint row separators */
    color: #F0F0F0;
    border: 1px solid #007ACC; /* Subtle border using accent color */
    selection-background-color: #007ACC; /* Accent Color for selection */
    selection-color: white;
}

QHeaderView::section {
    /* Style for Column Headers */
    background-color: #282828; /* Slightly lighter shade for headers */
    color: #FFFFFF;
    border: none;
    padding: 6px;
    font-size: 11pt;
    font-weight: bold;
}

QLineEdit {
    /* Style for input fields (e.g., in the side panel or search) */
    background-color: #1A1A1A;
    border: 1px solid #444444;
    color: #F0F0F0;
    padding: 5px;
}

QPushButton {
    /* Flat button style for toolbar */
    background-color: transparent;
    border: none;
    color: #F0F0F0;
    padding: 8px 12px;
}

QPushButton:hover {
    /* Hover effect */
    background-color: #2A2A2A;
    border: 1px solid #007ACC;
}
```

*** Create basic manual                                                :code:

We should start populating the manual from the start. Ensure there is a claude
skill that updates the manual as we add new entities. Create a PDF build for it.
We can use templates from thesis. Link it to site so that yuo can browse it.

*** Do not return sensitive fields                                     :code:

As per code review:

#+begin_quote
Major Security Flaw (list_accounts_response): The serialization format
explicitly includes highly sensitive fields (password_hash, password_salt,
totp_secret) for every domain::account returned. This is a severe security risk.
These fields must not be exposed over any messaging protocol, even internal
ones, unless it is a dedicated, highly protected replication channel.

Proposed Change: Create a protocol-safe subset structure, e.g.,
domain::account_summary, which contains only non-sensitive data (id, username,
email, is_admin, version, modified_by). Update list_accounts_response to use
std::vector<domain::account_summary>.

Change list_accounts_response::accounts to use a non-sensitive type like
std::vector<domain::account_summary>.

*** Local versus remote connectivity                                   :code:

In some cases it makes sense to use the UI directly against the database - for
example, users may just want to create a simple setup to play around and the
complexity of having to have a server is not helpful. In addition, they may not
even require a full blown postgres - sqlite is enough. It should be possible to
setup a connection to a database in this manner. Ideally the client should
support both at the same time.

*** Allow in place editing of currencies                               :code:

For expediency users should be able to edit multiple currencies and save them in
one go directly in the grid. Shift enter to edit a field seems interesting.

Users need to be made aware when there are changes in CRUD objects, and there
needs to be a reload button to reload data from the database in that case. This
could be done by making the reload button a different colour when data is
available.

Make the reload button blue when there are changes.

Notes:

- history windows should also have the notification.

*** Light system theme results in mix of dark and light                :code:

We need to ensure we can have both light and dark themes and they work
consistently.

*** Setup Qt properly on Windows                                       :code:

Seems like our package is still missing Qt DLLs. Use the windows tool to
determine what is missing. Consider installing Qt in the build machine via the
built packages.

*** Add SC script on windows to install ores.service                   :code:

We should package a trivial batch file that sets up the service on windows. We
should also consider adding a simple script to setup the service on Linux.
Ideally it should be done via the packaging step.

*** Package SQL scripts                                                :code:

We need to initialise the database on installation. The package should contain
all of the necessary SQL as well as a script to do it.

Or maybe we should do everything from within sqlgen and generate the scripts for
the cases where we need manual work in database.

*** Remove postgres passwords from github workflows                    :code:

As a quick hack we added the dev passwords to the workflows. We should really
generate these on the fly and supply them to the tests.

*** Allow supplying the postgres connection URI                        :code:

At present we are supplying all of the components for the connection. It may be
easier to allow the entire URI:

- connection-uri: The connection URI to connect to PostgreSQL. Example:
  =postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost/postgres=.

*** Consider adding MCP support                                        :code:

From Kaggle course:

#+begin_quote
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that lets agents use
community-built integrations. Instead of writing your own integrations and API
clients, just connect to an existing MCP server.

MCP enables agents to:

- Access live, external data from databases, APIs, and services without custom
  integration code
- Leverage community-built tools with standardized interfaces
- Scale capabilities by connecting to multiple specialized servers

2.1: How MCP Works

MCP connects your agent (the client) to external MCP servers that provide tools:

- MCP Server: Provides specific tools (like image generation, database access)
- MCP Client: Your agent that uses those tools

All servers work the same way - standardized interface Architecture:

┌──────────────────┐
│   Your Agent     │
│   (MCP Client)   │
└────────┬─────────┘
         │
         │ Standard MCP Protocol
         │
    ┌────┴────┬────────┬────────┐
    │         │        │        │
    ▼         ▼        ▼        ▼
┌────────┐ ┌─────┐ ┌──────┐ ┌─────┐
│ GitHub │ │Slack│ │ Maps │ │ ... │
│ Server │ │ MCP │ │ MCP  │ │     │
└────────┘ └─────┘ └──────┘ └─────┘

*** Add country support                                                :code:

We will probably need country support at some point. We should link the country
to the currencies, where applicable.

*** Log file location for Qt application is non-standard on Linux      :code:

At present we need to manually create the log directory for the gui to fix this
error:

#+begin_quote
[marco@lovelace bin]$ ./ores.qt
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::filesystem::filesystem_error'
  what():  boost::filesystem::create_directories: Permission denied [system:13]: "/opt/OreStudio/0.0.3/bin/../log", "/opt/OreStudio/0.0.3/bin/../log"
Aborted                    ./ores.qt
#+end_quote

We should really output the log file in a standard location such as /var/log or
something.

*** Create shared object interfaces                                    :code:

At present we are building shared objects / DLLs for the ores components, but we
did not bother defining proper interfaces, exporting symbols etc. This causes
problems on windows:

#+begin_src sh
LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'projects\ores.utility\ores.utility.lib'
#+end_src

This is happening because we are not exporting explicitly any symbols. To fix
this we did a hack:

#+begin_src cmake
if(WIN32 AND MSVC)
    # Export all symbols on windows for now. Bit of a hack.
    set(CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS ON)
endif()
#+end_src

The right solution for this is to annotate all the public types of each SO
correctly, exporting symbols for all platforms:

Deep seek analysis:

#+begin_src markdown
Yes, Boost provides a cross-platform wrapper for exporting symbols using the
`BOOST_SYMBOL_EXPORT` macro from the **Boost.DLL** library. This macro abstracts
away the compiler-specific keywords required for different platforms.

### 🗂️ Boost's Cross-Platform Symbol Exporting

To export a symbol, you use the `BOOST_SYMBOL_EXPORT` macro in your code. Under
the hood, it expands to the correct compiler-specific attribute:

- On **Windows** with MSVC, it becomes `__declspec(dllexport)`
- On **macOS** and **Linux** with GCC/Clang, it becomes `__attribute__((visibility("default")))`

Here is a basic example of how to use it to export a global variable:

```cpp
#include <boost/config.hpp> // For BOOST_SYMBOL_EXPORT

class my_plugin_api {
    // Your interface definition
};

namespace my_namespace {
    class my_plugin_sum : public my_plugin_api {
        // Implementation
    };

    // Export the 'plugin' variable
    extern "C" BOOST_SYMBOL_EXPORT my_plugin_sum plugin;
    my_plugin_sum plugin;
}
```
,*Note: The `extern "C"` is used here to prevent C++ name mangling, making the symbol name
predictable for tools that use C linkage. This is often crucial for a library's public API.*

For exporting factory functions, Boost offers the `BOOST_DLL_ALIAS` macro, which
is often more convenient:

```cpp
#include <boost/dll/alias.hpp> // For BOOST_DLL_ALIAS

namespace my_namespace {
    class my_plugin_aggregator : public my_plugin_api {
        // Implementation
    };

    // Factory function
    boost::shared_ptr<my_plugin_api> create() {
        return boost::shared_ptr<my_plugin_aggregator>(new my_plugin_aggregator());
    }

    // Export the factory function with the alias "create_plugin"
    BOOST_DLL_ALIAS(my_namespace::create, create_plugin)
}
```

### 💡 A Complementary Approach: Controlling Visibility

While Boost's macro solves the declaration problem, for finer control and to
minimize your shared library's public API, combine it with compiler flags that
hide all symbols by default.

- **On Linux and other ELF platforms**, use the `-fvisibility=hidden` flag. You
  can then use a **linker version script** to explicitly list the symbols you
  want to export.
- **On macOS**, use the `-fvisibility=hidden` flag and an **exported symbols
  list** with `-exported_symbols_list` during linking.
- **On Windows**, symbol visibility is typically controlled explicitly via
  `__declspec(dllexport)` or a module definition (.def) file, which
  `BOOST_SYMBOL_EXPORT` already handles.

Setting default visibility to hidden helps create a cleaner, more efficient
library by reducing its footprint, improving load times, and avoiding potential
symbol conflicts.

### 🔧 Summary

For a complete cross-platform solution:

1. **Use Boost.DLL macros**: Incorporate `BOOST_SYMBOL_EXPORT` or
   `BOOST_DLL_ALIAS` in your code to handle platform-specific export keywords.
2. **Hide symbols by default**: Compile your shared library with
   `-fvisibility=hidden` on Linux and macOS. This works in conjunction with the
   Boost macros.
3. **Use version scripts (optional)**: For maximum control on ELF platforms
   (Linux) or via an exported symbols list on macOS, use these linker features
   to define a precise public API.

I hope this helps you build your cross-platform shared library! If you have more
questions about using the Boost.DLL library for loading these symbols at
runtime, feel free to ask.

*** Add trace context propagation to messaging protocol                 :code:

To enable distributed tracing across client and server, trace context needs to
be propagated in the messaging protocol.

Tasks:

- Extend frame header to include optional trace_id and span_id fields.
- Update frame serialization/deserialization.
- Client includes trace context in outgoing request frames.
- Server extracts trace context and creates child spans linked to client's
  trace.

*** Create span collection and export infrastructure                    :code:

The telemetry component has span types defined but no infrastructure to collect
and export completed spans.

Tasks:

- Create =span_collector= interface for accumulating completed spans.
- Implement =span_exporter= interface (similar to =log_exporter=).
- Create =file_span_exporter= that writes spans as JSON Lines.
- Integrate span export with =lifecycle_manager= or create =telemetry_provider=.

*** Add OTLP exporter for OpenTelemetry collector                       :code:

- Implement =otlp_log_exporter= for log records.
- Implement =otlp_span_exporter= for traces.
- Add configuration for collector endpoint.

The files are as follows. First, there are the files in the =Input= directory:

- [[https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine/tree/master/Examples/Example_1/Input][Example 1 Inputs]]

Specifically:

- =currencies.xml=
- =netting.xml=

- =plot.gp=
- =portfolio.xml=
- =portfolio_swap.xml=
- =portfolio_swap_20151023.xml=

- [[https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine/tree/master/Examples/Input][Examples - Common Inputs]]

These are:

- =calendaradjustment.xml=
- =conventions.xml=
- =currencies.xml=

*** Consider adding support for A/B testing                            :code:

At present feature flags are global. However, we may want to enable a feature
for a subset of the population. Analysis:

#+begin_src markdown
To support **gradual rollout (ramping)** of features—e.g., enabling a feature
for 10% of users, then 50%, then 100%—you need to extend your feature flag
system beyond a simple boolean toggle. The current temporal table design
(`feature_flags` with validity periods) is great for time-based control, but
,**not sufficient for user-based targeting**.

Here’s a practical, scalable approach that integrates well with your C++23/Qt/PostgreSQL stack:

---

### 🎯 Goal
Enable a feature **conditionally** based on:
- User identity (e.g., user ID, tenant ID, or client ID)
- A **rollout percentage** (e.g., 10%)
- Optional: user attributes (role, region, etc.)

### ✅ Step 1: Enhance the Feature Flag Schema

Add **rollout strategy metadata** to your `feature_flags` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE oresdb.feature_flags
ADD COLUMN rollout_percentage INTEGER CHECK (rollout_percentage BETWEEN 0 AND 100) DEFAULT 100,
ADD COLUMN targeting_criteria JSONB; -- optional, for advanced rules
```

Now each flag version can specify:
- `rollout_percentage = 10` → enable for ~10% of users
- `targeting_criteria = '{"role": "beta_tester"}'` → (future extensibility)

> Keep your temporal primary key and exclusion constraint — they still apply.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Determine a Stable User Identifier

Your client must provide a **consistent, hashable ID** per user or session, such as:
- User ID (if authenticated)
- Device ID / client UUID (if anonymous)
- Tenant ID (for multi-tenant apps)

This ID must be **stable** across sessions so the same user doesn’t see the feature flicker on/off.

> 💡 In your Qt client, generate or retrieve this ID at startup and pass it to the feature flag service.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Implement Consistent Hash-Based Sampling in C++

Use a **deterministic hash** to map user IDs into a 0–99 bucket:

```cpp
#include <functional>
#include <string>

bool should_enable_for_user(std::string_view feature_name,
                            std::string_view user_id,
                            int rollout_percentage) {
    if (rollout_percentage <= 0) return false;
    if (rollout_percentage >= 100) return true;

    // Combine feature name + user ID to avoid correlation across features
    std::string key = std::string(feature_name) + ":" + std::string(user_id);

    // Use a stable hash (e.g., std::hash, but note: not guaranteed consistent across runs)
    // For production, prefer a consistent hash like FNV-1a or CityHash
    auto hash = std::hash<std::string>{}(key);
    int bucket = static_cast<int>(hash % 100);
    return bucket < rollout_percentage;
}
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**: `std::hash` is **not guaranteed to be stable across program runs or platforms**.
> For reliable rollout, use a **stable hashing algorithm** like **FNV-1a**, **MurmurHash3**, or **xxHash**.

Example with a simple FNV-1a (C++23-friendly):

```cpp
constexpr uint32_t fnv1a_32(std::string_view s) {
    uint32_t hash = 2166136261u; // FNV offset basis
    for (char c : s) {
        hash ^= static_cast<uint8_t>(c);
        hash *= 16777619u; // FNV prime
    }
    return hash;
}

bool should_enable_for_user(std::string_view feature_name,
                            std::string_view user_id,
                            int rollout_percentage) {
    if (rollout_percentage <= 0) return false;
    if (rollout_percentage >= 100) return true;

    std::string key{feature_name};
    key += ':';
    key += user_id;

    uint32_t hash = fnv1a_32(key);
    return (hash % 100) < static_cast<uint32_t>(rollout_percentage);
}
```

This ensures:
- Same user → same decision
- Uniform distribution across users
- Independent per-feature rollout

---

### ✅ Step 4: Update Your Feature Flag Service

Modify your C++ `FeatureFlagService`:

```cpp
class FeatureFlagService {
public:
    // Returns true if the feature is enabled AND user qualifies
    bool is_enabled_for_user(Feature f, std::string_view user_id) const;

private:
    struct FlagConfig {
        bool enabled;
        int rollout_percentage; // 0–100
        // add targeting_criteria later if needed
    };
    std::unordered_map<Feature, FlagConfig> cache_;
};
```

Implementation:

```cpp
bool FeatureFlagService::is_enabled_for_user(Feature f, std::string_view user_id) const {
    auto it = cache_.find(f);
    if (it == cache_.end() || !it->second.enabled) {
        return false;
    }
    return should_enable_for_user(to_string(f), user_id, it->second.rollout_percentage);
}
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Integrate in Qt UI

```cpp
QString userId = getCurrentUserId(); // from auth, settings, etc.

if (featureFlagService.is_enabled_for_user(Feature::ExperimentalUI, userId.toStdString())) {
    ui->experimentalPanel->show();
}
```

---

### ✅ Optional: Advanced Targeting (Future-Proofing)

Use the `targeting_criteria JSONB` column to store rules like:
```json
{
  "min_version": "2.1.0",
  "regions": ["EU", "NA"],
  "roles": ["admin", "beta"]
}
```

Then evaluate these in C++ (or push filtering to DB with JSONB queries if you fetch per-user flags).

But for **simple ramp-up**, percentage-based hashing is sufficient and efficient.

---

### ✅ Operational Benefits

- **No client-side config changes** needed to ramp from 10% → 50% → 100% — just update the DB.
- **Auditability**: Every rollout change is versioned in your temporal table.
- **Safety**: You can instantly roll back by setting `rollout_percentage = 0`.

---

### Summary

| Component           | Change |
|---------------------|--------|
| **Database**        | Add `rollout_percentage INT` to `feature_flags` |
| **C++ Service**     | Add `is_enabled_for_user(feature, user_id)` |
| **Hashing**         | Use stable hash (e.g., FNV-1a) over `feature:user_id` |
| **Qt UI**           | Pass user ID to flag checks |

This gives you **safe, gradual, observable rollouts** while keeping your architecture clean and performant.

*** LLM Integration                                                    :code:

LLMs can be useful when learning a new subject as they can provide additional
context to the information displayed in the screen. For example, a user can ask
the LLM to explain a graph or a table. It would probably be fairly straight
forward to allow dumping some of the information in a format that is friendly to
LLMs (.e.g./ PNG, Markdown, plain text) and then make an API call to a local or
remote LLM. We could probably create a set of useful canned prompts (explain
this report, explain this chart).

On a more blue skies approach, one could conceive asking the LLM for suggestions
on how to act, on the basis of the analysis. This could result in suggestions
for action the user could implement, or even on actions directly taken based on
the LLM's suggestions. This is conceptually straightforward: the LLM could for
example generate a well defined JSON with the proposed action, and the system
would look for some predefined markers in the LLM output:

#+begin_src text
----- ACTION START
<JSON>
----- ACTION END
#+end_src

The JSON payload would describe the action:

#+begin_src json
{
    "action": "some_action_type",
    "key1": "value1",
    ....
#+end_src

A trivial lookup table could de-serialise the JSON and execute the action. All
that is required is for the LLM to "learn" how to generate JSON compliant with
the desired format, which should be quite straightforward (perhaps with the help
of fine-tuning). Agents probably provide most of this infrastructure already.
The key thing is to ensure all functionality in the core becomes UI agnostic
such that one could bolt an NLP UI around it.

*** Support multiple ORE "toolchains"                                  :code:

Much like with an IDE, where one can have multiple toolchains configured, we
need to also support multiple versions of ORE. Unlike with IDEs, it may be
desirable to run computations with more than one version of ORE for comparison
purposes. This means we need a way to associate outputs with their ORE version.
This approach does not necessarily fit the existing example code, because these
have a single "output directory". However, we just need  way to associate N
toolchains with a given workspace or possibly component; when present, the
output directory starts to reflect the toolchain configuration. For example,
with CMake we use presets:

- =linux-clang-debug=
- =linux-clang-release=
- =linux-gcc-debug=
- =linux-gcc-release=

For ORE the only dimension under which variability is possible is the version.
We can then have pricing engine configurations that are either the same, or
possibly different:

- for a workspace;
- for a component;
- for a toolchain version.
