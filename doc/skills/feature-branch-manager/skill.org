* When to use this skill

When working on multi-phase implementations that require multiple PRs. Use this
skill to transition between phases while maintaining a clean git history.

Typical scenarios:
- A PR for the current phase has been merged to main.
- You need to start work on the next phase of an implementation.
- You want to clean up old feature branches after merge.

* How to use this skill

1. Confirm the current PR has been merged to main.
2. Follow the phase transition procedure to create a fresh branch.
3. Continue with the next phase of work.

* Detailed instructions

** Branch naming conventions

Feature branches should follow this naming pattern:

#+begin_example
feature/<entity>_<phase_description>
#+end_example

Examples:
- =feature/currency_domain_type= - Phase 1: Domain class and I/O
- =feature/currency_generator= - Phase 2: Test data generator
- =feature/currency_repository= - Phase 3: Repository support
- =feature/currency_tests= - Phase 4: Tests and documentation

For Qt entity implementations:
- =feature/session_model_window= - Phase 1: Model and list window
- =feature/session_detail_dialog= - Phase 2: Detail dialog
- =feature/session_history_dialog= - Phase 3: History dialog
- =feature/session_controller= - Phase 4: Controller and integration

** Phase transition procedure

Execute the following steps to transition between phases:

*** Step 1: Note the current branch name

#+begin_src sh
git branch --show-current
#+end_src

Store this for cleanup in later steps.

*** Step 2: Check if current branch PR has been merged

Use the GitHub CLI to check if the PR for the current branch has been merged:

#+begin_src sh
gh pr view --json state,mergedAt
#+end_src

If the PR is merged, you'll see =state: MERGED= and a =mergedAt= timestamp.

Alternative using git (if gh is not available):

#+begin_src sh
git fetch origin main
git branch --contains $(git rev-parse HEAD) -r | grep origin/main
#+end_src

If the current branch's HEAD commit is contained in =origin/main=, the PR has
been merged.

*Important*: Only proceed if the PR has been merged. If not merged, inform the
user and stop.

*** Step 3: Stash uncommitted changes (if any)

Check for uncommitted changes and stash them:

#+begin_src sh
git status --short
#+end_src

If there are changes:

#+begin_src sh
git stash push -m "WIP: Transitioning to next phase"
#+end_src

*** Step 4: Fetch latest main

#+begin_src sh
git fetch origin main
#+end_src

*** Step 5: Create new feature branch

Create a new branch from the updated main for the next phase:

#+begin_src sh
git checkout -b feature/<entity>_<next_phase> origin/main
#+end_src

*** Step 6: Restore stashed changes (if any)

If changes were stashed in Step 3:

#+begin_src sh
git stash pop
#+end_src

*** Step 7: Delete old local branch

#+begin_src sh
git branch -d <old_branch_name>
#+end_src

Use =-D= (force delete) only if the branch wasn't fully merged (rare).

*** Step 8: Delete old remote branch

#+begin_src sh
git push origin --delete <old_branch_name>
#+end_src

This keeps the remote repository clean.

** Complete example

Transitioning from Phase 1 (domain type) to Phase 2 (generator) for currency:

#+begin_src sh
# Step 1: Note current branch
git branch --show-current
# Output: feature/currency_domain_type

# Step 2: Check if PR has been merged
gh pr view --json state,mergedAt
# Output: {"mergedAt":"2025-01-10T14:30:00Z","state":"MERGED"}

# Step 3: Stash any uncommitted changes
git status --short
# Output: M doc/agile/v0/sprint_backlog_08.org
git stash push -m "WIP: Transitioning to next phase"

# Step 4: Fetch latest main (includes the merged PR)
git fetch origin main

# Step 5: Create new branch for Phase 2
git checkout -b feature/currency_generator origin/main

# Step 6: Restore stashed changes
git stash pop

# Step 7: Delete old local branch
git branch -d feature/currency_domain_type

# Step 8: Delete old remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/currency_domain_type
#+end_src

** Important notes

- *Never rebase and force push* - This creates confusing history and can cause
  issues for reviewers.
- *Always start from fresh main* - Each phase gets a clean branch from the
  latest main, which includes all previously merged work.
- *Delete branches after merge* - Keeps both local and remote repositories clean.
- *Use descriptive branch names* - Makes it easy to identify what phase/work the
  branch represents.
- *Stash handling is automatic* - Uncommitted changes are preserved across phase
  transitions.
