This document contains the [[http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/product-backlog][product backlog]] for VisualOre.

* Product Vision

guides us when we think about the product and what can and cannot go into the
product backlog.

The vision for VisualOre is:

** Vision Quotes

* Release Checklist

Steps to create a new release.

** Close previous sprint

To be done on the last Sunday of the sprint.

1. Make a copy of current sprint backlog and name it current sprint + 1 but
   don't check it in.
2. Move all untouched stories into product backlog.
3. Close current sprint: close all open tasks, delete tasks we did not work on,
   update clocks.
4. Push commit and wait for builds. This ensures that if there are any failures
   you can fix them before the release tag.
4. Tag commit and sign it with key.
5. Push tag. You can generate new builds overnight.

** Open new sprint

To be done on the Monday morning of the new sprint.

1. Open new sprint, updating CMake version, README, GitHub, and decoration
   formatter tests. Build all and run tests (some will fail). This should all be
   in one commit.
2. Create a demo. Publish it on youtube.
3. Write up release notes, publish them in github.
4. When tag build is finished, unpack and copy binaries into release, announce
   on gitter, twitter and linked in.
