#+title: Sprint Backlog

All work undertaken is captured into stories, and these are grouped into
sprints. A sprint is made up of around eighty hours of work, at which point we
/close/ it and make a new [[https://github.com/OreStudio/OreStudio/releases][release]]. Each sprint is organised around a /sprint
mission/, which is made up of one or two themes. The sprint we are currently
working on is called the /active sprint/. All other non-active sprints are
read-only archives of past activity.

We group sprints by /version/. Each version has a /version mission/. The version
mission is the overall objective for that particular group of sprints. We
/close/ a version when that objective has been achieved. The version we are
currently working on is called the /active version/. The version is encoded into
CMake as the /major version/ (i.e. [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR.html][CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR]]) and the sprint
as the /minor version/ (i.e. [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION.html#variable:CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION][CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION]]). For example, the following
[[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_VERSION.html][CMAKE_VERSION]] 0.1.0 is /version 0/ for /sprint 1/.
