    end note
}

' Domain Layer
package "Domain Layer" #LIGHTYELLOW {
    component [ores.risk] as risk #ECECEC

    note right of risk
    Core domain model for Open Risk Engine (ORE) types following ORE specifications:
    - Domain: Currency entities with temporal versioning (valid_from/valid_to)
    - ORE XML: Import/export to native ORE format using pugixml
    - CSV Export: Structured CSV output for currencies
    - JSON I/O: Serialization using reflection (rfl library)
    - Table I/O: Formatted table output using fort library
    - Persistence: ORM entities, mappers, and repositories with temporal support
    - Message API: Request/response handlers for currency operations (0x3000-0x3FFF)
    - Test Data: Synthetic data generation using faker-cxx
    Organized into: domain, repository, orexml, csv, messaging, generators namespaces.
    end note

    component [ores.accounts] as accounts #ECECEC

    note right of accounts
    Comprehensive user account management with secure authentication:
    - Account Lifecycle: Creation, listing, and deletion of user accounts
    - Authentication: Secure password hashing using scrypt, login tracking
    - Security: Account locking after failed login attempts, unlock capability
    - Feature Flags: Runtime feature toggles with audit tracking
    - Message API: Async request/response handlers (0x2000-0x2FFF)
    - Temporal Support: Version tracking with valid_from/valid_to fields
    - Test Data: Synthetic account generation for development
    Organized into: domain, repository, service, messaging, security, generators namespaces.
    end note
}

' Application Layer
package "Application Layer" #LIGHTCORAL {
    component [ores.shell] as shell #ECECEC

    note right of shell
    Interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) shell for connecting to ORE Studio server:
    - Interface: Interactive command-line with command completion
    - Connection Management: Connect/disconnect to ORE Studio server
    - Currency Operations: List and retrieve currency data
    - Account Operations: Create accounts, login, list accounts, unlock accounts
    - Auto-Connect: Automatic connection and login from configuration file
    - Configuration: Boost program_options for CLI argument parsing
    - Command Handlers: Modular command classes for connection, currencies, and accounts
    Organized into: config (configuration parsing), app (REPL, client manager, commands) namespaces.
    end note

    component [ores.cli] as cli #ECECEC

    note right of cli
    Command-line interface for importing and exporting ORE data:
    - Import: Load currencies from JSON, XML, or CSV files into database
    - Export: Extract currencies to JSON, XML, or CSV format
    - Temporal Queries: Export data as-of specific timepoints or all versions
