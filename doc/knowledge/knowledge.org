This folder contains assorted knowledge we picked up as part of implementing
this project. It is mainly made up of short definitions created by LLMs (Gemini,
Grok, etc) and is there to help us when we are looking at certain aspects of the
code; we can then rely on org-roam to get the required context for some
technical terms. This page serves as a "general index" of the knowledge.
