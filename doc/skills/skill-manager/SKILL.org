* When to use this skill

When the user requests the creation of a new skill or updating of an existing
skill.

* How to use this skill

1. *Identify the skill* from the request. If it's not clear, request more
   information from the user.
2. Check the skill library to see if any skills exist that match the request. If
   not create a new skill.
3. Follow the rules under Detailed instructions to manage the request.

* Detailed instructions

The next sections contain a set of detailed instructions that must be followed
when handling requests for the creation of new skills or updating existing
skills.

** ORE Studio skill setup

- All claude code skill templates are stored under =doc/skills= as org-mode
  documents.
- These then generate actual skills under =.claude/skills= via CMake targets. DO
  NOT EVER modify =.claude/skills= directly as your changes will be overwritten.

** Creating new skills

To create a new skill:

- Agree the skill name with the user. Help the user come up with a concise name
  for the skill, which does not overlap with existing skills.
- Create a new folder under =doc/skills/SKILL-NAME=, replacing =SKILL-NAME= with
  the actual skill name. Folders should be all in lower case with dashes
  separating words. Example =my-new-skil=.
- Create a new file inside the new folder called =skill.org=. The file must
  have the following structure:

  - Preamble:

#+begin_src fundamental
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: GUID
:END:
#+title: TITLE
#+author: Marco Craveiro
#+options: <:nil c:nil todo:nil ^:nil d:nil date:nil author:nil toc:nil
#+startup: inlineimages
#+export_exclude_tags: noexport

#+begin_export markdown

name: SKILL-NAME
description: SKILL DESCRIPTION
license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt

#+end_export
#+end_src

     Updating the following fields:
        - =GUID=: use =python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"= to generate a new UUID.
        - =TITLE=: title for the new skill, short and descriptive, properly
          capitalised.
        - =SKILL-NAME=: must match the folder used by the new skill.
        - =SKILL DESCRIPTION=: short one line skill description.

  - Body:
    - Add a section called "When to use this skill". It should identify the use
      cases for the skill. It should be a short paragraph.
    - Add a section called "How to use this skill". It should be composed of a
      set of concise steps on how to use the skill. If the skill requires more
      than 2 or 3 steps, point the reader to a section called "Detailed
      instructions".
    - If necessary add a section called "Detailed instructions" with step by
      step description of the skill.

  - Postamble:
    - Add the following:

#+begin_src fundamental

    - Update the file =doc/skills/claude_code_skills.org= in section "Available
      Skills" with a link to new skill, following the pattern of the previous
      skills.
    - Update the skill dependencies diagram
      =doc/skills/modeling/skill_dependencies.puml= to add the new skill and its
      dependencies on other skills. See [[*Skill dependencies diagram][Skill dependencies diagram]] for details.

** Skill dependencies diagram

The skill dependencies diagram shows how skills reference each other. When
creating a new skill, add it to the appropriate package and define its
dependencies.

Location: =doc/skills/modeling/skill_dependencies.puml=

*** Packages

Skills are grouped into packages by category:

| Package         | Stereotype       | Color   | Description                          |
|-----------------+------------------+---------+--------------------------------------|
| Foundation      | =<<foundation>>= | #E8F5E9 | Core skills used by many others      |
| Entity Creators | =<<entity>>=     | #E3F2FD | Skills for entity support            |
| Recipes         | =<<recipe>>=     | #FFF3E0 | Executable documentation maintenance |
| Utilities       | =<<utility>>=    | #F3E5F5 | Supporting skills for specific tasks |
| Workflow        | =<<workflow>>=   | #FFEBEE | Development workflow and process     |

*** Adding a new skill

1. Add the skill component to the appropriate package:

#+begin_src plantuml
[skill-name] <<stereotype>> as alias
#+end_src

2. Add dependencies (arrows show "references" relationship):

#+begin_src plantuml
alias --> other_skill
#+end_src

3. Regenerate the diagram:

#+begin_src sh
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-debug --target generate_skill_dependencies_diagram
#+end_src

** Updating existing skills

To update an existing skill:

- Locate the skill under =doc/skills=
- Update the org-mode file in the desired location.
- Inform the user the update has been performed and that skills need to be
  regenerated.

** Testing skills

After creating or updating a skill, run both CMake targets to verify the changes
don't break any builds:

#+begin_src sh
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-debug --target deploy_skills
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-debug --target deploy_site
#+end_src

The =deploy_skills= target generates the Claude Code skills under =.claude/skills=.
The =deploy_site= target generates the documentation website and can break if
there are issues with org-mode links or formatting in skill files.

Both must complete successfully before committing skill changes.
