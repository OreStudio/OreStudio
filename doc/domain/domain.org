Documentation about the domain of finance. These are assorted notes I have
collected over the years and are of some relevance to this application.

* Money and its Close Relatives

#+begin_verse
Finance is concerned with the relations between the values of
securities and their risk, and with the behavior of those values. It
aspires to be a practical field, like physics or chemistry or electrical
engineering. As John Maynard Keynes once remarked about economics, “If
economists could manage to get themselves thought of as humble, competent
people on a level with dentists, that would be splendid.” Dentists rely on
science, engineering, empirical knowledge, and heuristics, and there are
no theorems in dentistry. Similarly, one would hope that finance would be
concerned with laws rather than theorems, with behavior rather than
assumptions. One doesn’t seriously describe the behavior of a market with
theorems.

As they say, it's always best to start a story at the beginning. However,
problem domains are not simple yarns that merely need unspooling. The very
notions of domain order and structure are artificial constructs, coarse
linearisations imposed by those attempting to make sense of the mess of concepts
and relationships between entities, as well as their behaviours. Because it is
imposed, such structure will always be inadequate; what is left to the writer is
to choose how inadequate the linear presentation will be.

These structural problems are particularly acute in finance and its sister
subject economics because, unlike other subjects, they are hostile environments
to the scientific method (/c.f./ Section FIXME #chap1:discussion). As Derman and
Miller informed us, "Markets are plagued with anomalies that violate standard
financial theories (or, more accurately, theories are plagued by their inability
to systematically account for the actual behaviour of markets)."
citep:derman2016volatility It is important to take this subjectivity into
account as we enter our first foray into the domain.
