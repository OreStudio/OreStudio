Data Quality (DQ) is the measure of how well a dataset satisfies the
requirements of its intended business use. In financial markets, high-quality
data is defined as being accurate, complete, timely, and traceable, ensuring
that automated trading decisions and risk calculations are based on a "single
version of the truth" rather than corrupted or ambiguous artefacts.

* The Standard Dimensions - The "DQ 6"

There are six industry-standard dimensions used by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8000][ISO 8000]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Management_Association][DAMA]]:

- *Accuracy*: The degree to which data values match the "Golden Source" (e.g.,
  a Bloomberg price vs. your sample).
- *Completeness*: The presence of all mandatory attributes (e.g., no missing
  ISIN or Strike Price).
- *Consistency*: The absence of contradictions across different tables or
  systems (e.g., USD/EUR rate is the same in your "Sample" and "Derived"
  tables).
- *Timeliness*: The readiness of data for its specific window (e.g., "T+0"
  real-time vs. "T+1" end-of-day).
- *Validity*: Adherence to business rules and formats (e.g., Currency codes must
  follow ISO 4217).
- *Uniqueness*: Ensuring no duplicate records exist for the same entity and
  timestamp.

* Relevant Industry bodies and standards

** DAMA-DMBOK (Data Management Body of Knowledge)

- Focus: Best practices and principles for managing data as a strategic asset
  (including Data Governance, Data Quality, Data Modeling, etc.).
- Role: Provides detailed practices for Data Architecture, encompassing data
  modeling and integration, and defines how these elements align with specific
  business requirements.

** TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework)

- Focus: Design, planning, implementation, and governance of Enterprise
  Architecture, ensuring IT alignment with strategic business goals.
- Role: Features a dedicated Data Architecture phase (Phase C), which leverages
  DAMA principles to build a scalable data ecosystem that fits within the
  broader organizational structure.

* Key domain concepts

- *Dataset*: A logical collection of sample records (e.g., a set of trades,
  portfolios, or market data snapshots).
- *Record*: An individual row or entity within a dataset (optional granularity;
  lineage may be tracked at dataset or record level).
- *Provenance*: The origin of the data—external vendor, internal system, or
  synthetic generator.
- *Classification*: Categorizes the nature of the data for compliance and usage
  control.
- *Lineage*: Directed acyclic graph (DAG) linking derived data to its upstream
  sources.
- *Temporal Context*: Captures both business time (=as_of_date=) and system time
  (=ingestion_timestamp=), supporting bi-temporal reasoning.
- *Data Passport*: A self-contained metadata manifest (relational or
  document-based) that answers the 5 Ws of data governance.
- *Quality metrics*: Define and store validation rules and quality measurements.
- *Change Management*: Maintain history of data changes (who did what, when and
  for what reason.
- *Data profiling*: Store statistical metadata about data characteristics.
