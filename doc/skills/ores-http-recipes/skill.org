* When to use this skill

Use this skill when:
- The user wants to update the ORE Studio HTTP recipes documentation
- New HTTP endpoints have been added and need to be documented
- Existing HTTP routes have changed and recipes need updating
- API request/response formats have been modified and need verification

* How to use this skill

1. Compare the routes in =projects/ores.http.server/src/routes= to
   =doc/recipes/http_recipes.org=.
2. Identify any missing endpoints that are not documented.
3. Add recipes for missing endpoints following the existing pattern.
4. Use the Detailed Instructions section for the proper recipe format.

* Detailed instructions

** Recipe file location

The HTTP recipes are stored in =doc/recipes/http_recipes.org=. This file
demonstrates all functionality available in the ORE Studio HTTP API using Emacs
[[https://github.com/federicotdn/verb][verb mode]].

** Route source locations

Routes are implemented in the following files:
- =projects/ores.http.server/src/routes/iam_routes.cpp=: Authentication, accounts, RBAC, sessions
- =projects/ores.http.server/src/routes/risk_routes.cpp=: Currencies
- =projects/ores.http.server/src/routes/variability_routes.cpp=: Feature flags
- =projects/ores.http.server/src/routes/assets_routes.cpp=: Currency images and assets

New entity routes should be added following the [[id:bdcc47d4-b050-409e-8c50-3d179843a274][http-entity-creator]] skill.

** Recipe format

Each recipe follows this pattern using Emacs verb mode syntax:

#+begin_src fundamental
*** Recipe Name

Description of what this recipe demonstrates.

#+begin_src verb :wrap src json
METHOD /path
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{(verb-var token)}}

{
    "field": "value"
}
#+end_src
#+end_src

Key elements:
- Use =verb= as the source block language
- Add =:wrap src json= to format JSON responses
- Include =Accept: application/json= header for all requests
- Include =Content-Type: application/json= for requests with bodies
- Use =Authorization: Bearer {{(verb-var token)}}= for authenticated endpoints

** Recipe sections

Recipes are organized into sections:

- *Authentication*: Bootstrap status, bootstrap, login, signup, logout
- *Accounts*: List, create, update, delete, history, login info, lock, unlock, reset password
- *Current User*: Change password, update email
- *RBAC*: List roles, get role, list permissions, account roles/permissions, assign/revoke roles
- *Sessions*: List sessions, statistics, active sessions
- *Currencies*: List, save, delete, history
- *Feature Flags*: List feature flags
- *Assets*: Currency images, get images

** Verifying routes

When checking routes, compare the endpoint definitions in the route files with
the recipes. Common issues include:

- Missing endpoints not documented
- Changed URL paths (e.g., =/accounts= vs =/users=)
- Modified HTTP methods (GET vs POST)
- Updated request body fields
- Changed response formats
- New query parameters (offset, limit for pagination)

** Adding a new recipe

1. Identify which section the endpoint belongs to.
2. Check the route file for the exact URL path and HTTP method.
3. Create a verb src block with the HTTP request.
4. Include appropriate headers (Accept, Content-Type, Authorization).
5. For endpoints with request bodies, include a JSON example.
6. Add a descriptive paragraph explaining what the recipe demonstrates.
7. Run the request to capture a sample response in the =#+RESULTS:= block.

** Recipe naming conventions

- Use title case for recipe names: =List Accounts=, =Create Currency=
- Be descriptive: =Get Account History= not just =History=
- Group related endpoints: =Lock Accounts=, =Unlock Accounts=

** Template variables

The recipes use verb-mode variables for dynamic values. Set these using
=M-x verb-set-var= before running authenticated requests:

| Variable   | Description                | Example                              |
|------------+----------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| token      | JWT authentication token   | eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9 |
| account_id | UUID of an account         | 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc |
| role_id    | UUID of a role             | 87654321-4321-4321-4321-cba987654321 |
| image_id   | UUID of an image           | abcdef12-3456-7890-abcd-ef1234567890 |

** Running recipes

To use the HTTP recipes:

1. Ensure =verb= package is installed in Emacs
2. Start the HTTP server: =ores.http.server=
3. Position cursor on a request and run =C-c C-r C-r= (=verb-send-request-on-point=)

All requests inherit from the base URL template defined at the top of the
requests section: =template http://localhost:8081/api/v1=
