* When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user asks you to work semi-autonomously on a specific
story with minimal human intervention. This skill combines agile story
management with incremental development, comprehensive testing, and proper git
workflow.

This is ideal for:

- Working through a single user specified story.
- Implementing features with proper testing at each step.
- Maintaining clean git history with incremental commits.
- Creating professional pull requests for review.
- Following established development workflow automatically.

* How to Use This Skill

When the user asks you to work semi-autonomously on a story:

1. Find the story requested by the user in the current sprint backlog.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Plan and implement the story incrementally.
4. Test and commit at each step.
5. Mark the story as BLOCKED (awaiting review).
6. Push the branch and create a pull request.

* Detailed Instructions

** Step 1: Select Story from Sprint Backlog

*** Identify Current Sprint Backlog

1. List files in =doc/agile/v0/= matching pattern =sprint_backlog_*.org=
2. Find the file with the highest sprint number - this is the current sprint
3. Read the sprint backlog file and find the story chosen by the user.

** Step 2: Create Feature Branch

*** Branch Naming Convention

Create a feature branch with the format:

#+begin_src sh
feature/summary-of-story-title
#+end_src

Rules for branch name:

1. *Lowercase* - all letters should be lowercase
2. *Hyphen-separated* - use hyphens to separate words
3. *Concise* - use 3-5 key words from story title
4. *Descriptive* - should indicate what the feature is about

Examples:

- Story: "Implement delete account" → =feature/implement-delete-account=
- Story: "Add protocol version to splash screen" → =feature/add-protocol-version-splash=
- Story: "Refactor error handling in client" → =feature/refactor-client-errors=

*** Git Commands

#+begin_src sh
# Ensure we're on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and checkout feature branch
git checkout -b feature/summary-of-story-title
#+end_src

** Step 3: Manage Story Using Agile Practices

Follow the Agile Product Owner skill practices:

*** Mark Story as STARTED

Update the story status in the sprint backlog:

#+begin_src fundamental
,*** STARTED Story title                                              :code:
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2025-11-18 Tue 10:30]
    :END:
#+end_src

*** Create Implementation Plan

Under the story, add or update a =Tasks= section with a detailed,
incremental plan:

#+begin_src fundamental
,***** Tasks

- [ ] Step 1: Initial setup and scaffolding
- [ ] Step 2: Implement core functionality
- [ ] Step 3: Add tests
- [ ] Step 4: Handle edge cases
- [ ] Step 5: Update documentation
- [ ] Step 6: Final testing and cleanup
#+end_src

*** Task Characteristics

Each task should be:

1. *Small and incremental* - completable in 15-30 minutes
2. *Testable* - can be verified independently
3. *Committable* - produces a meaningful git commit
4. *Clear* - unambiguous what needs to be done

** Step 4: Implement Incrementally

For each task in your plan:

*** Implementation Cycle

1. *Implement* - Write the code for the current task
2. *Compile* - Build the project to ensure it compiles
3. *Test* - Run all relevant tests
4. *Commit* - Create a git commit if successful
5. *Update backlog* - Mark task as complete in sprint backlog

*** Detailed Steps

**** A. Implement the Task

Write the code needed for the current task. Keep changes focused and minimal.

**** B. Compile the Code

#+begin_src sh
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-debug
#+end_src

If compilation fails:

1. Fix the errors
2. Compile again
3. Repeat until successful
4. Do NOT proceed to next step until code compiles

**** C. Run Tests

Run appropriate tests based on what was changed:

#+begin_src sh
# For specific component tests
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-debug --target ores.COMPONENT.tests
./build/output/linux-clang-debug/publish/bin/ores.COMPONENT.tests

# For all tests (if time permits and changes are broad)
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-debug --target rat
#+end_src

If tests fail:

1. Fix the issues
2. Recompile if needed
3. Run tests again
4. Repeat until all tests pass
5. Do NOT proceed to next step until tests pass

**** D. Create Git Commit

Once code compiles and tests pass, create a descriptive commit:

#+begin_src sh
git add <relevant-files>
git commit -m "[COMPONENT] Brief description of what was done

More detailed explanation if needed, including:
- What specific functionality was added/changed
- Why this approach was chosen
- Any important implementation details

***** Git Commit Convention

Use the following prefix format:

- =[component]= - For code changes (e.g., =[comms]=, =[qt]=, =[cli]=)
- =[agile]= - For sprint backlog and agile documentation changes
- =[infra]= - For build system, CI/CD changes
- =[doc]= - For documentation changes

Examples:

#+begin_src fundamental
[comms] Add connection_error exception class

Created custom exception for connection errors to replace
the last_error_ member variable pattern. This provides
more idiomatic C++ error handling.

**** E. Update Sprint Backlog

After successful commit, mark the task as complete:

#+begin_src fundamental
,***** Tasks

- [X] Step 1: Initial setup and scaffolding
- [ ] Step 2: Implement core functionality
- [ ] Step 3: Add tests
#+end_src

Add implementation details under a =COMPLETED= subsection:

#+begin_src fundamental

#+end_src

** Step 5: Handle Clarifications

If you encounter ambiguity or need clarification:

*** Document Questions in Sprint Backlog

Add a =Questions= section to the story:

#+begin_src fundamental
,***** Questions

1. *Question*: Should we support both UUID and username for deletion?
   *Assumption*: Implementing both for flexibility. Can remove username
   support if not needed.

2. *Question*: What error message format should we use?
   *Assumption*: Following existing pattern from currency deletion.
   Will adjust if different format is preferred.
#+end_src

*** Make Best Judgment and Proceed

1. Document your assumption clearly
2. Implement based on that assumption
3. Proceed with the work
4. The user will review and provide feedback during PR review

*** Do Not Block on Clarifications

- Keep moving forward with reasonable assumptions
- Document all assumptions for review
- Avoid getting stuck waiting for answers
- Trust that PR review will catch any issues

** Step 6: Complete All Tasks

Continue the implementation cycle (Step 4) for each task until:

1. All tasks are marked =[X]= completed
2. All code compiles successfully
3. All tests pass
4. All changes are committed to git

** Step 7: Mark Story as BLOCKED

Once all implementation is complete:

*** Update Story Status

Change status from =STARTED= to =BLOCKED=:

#+begin_src fundamental
,*** BLOCKED Story title                                              :code:
CLOSED: [2025-11-18 Tue 15:30]
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2025-11-18 Tue 10:30]--[2025-11-18 Tue 15:30] =>  5:00
    :END:

** Step 8: Push Feature Branch

Push your feature branch to the remote repository:

#+begin_src sh
git push -u origin feature/summary-of-story-title
#+end_src

If push fails (e.g., branch already exists):

1. Check if someone else is working on this branch
2. If not, use =git push --force-with-lease= to update
3. Document in PR that force-push was needed

** Step 9: Create Pull Request

*** Generate PR Title and Description

* Best Practices

** Incremental Commits

- Commit early and often
- Each commit should be self-contained and buildable
- Commit messages should be descriptive and follow conventions
- Avoid large "kitchen sink" commits

** Testing Discipline

- Always run tests before committing
- Fix failing tests immediately
- Add tests for new functionality
- Verify tests actually test what they claim to test

** Documentation as You Go

- Update sprint backlog continuously
- Document decisions and assumptions
- Mark tasks complete immediately after committing
- Keep notes section current with implementation details

** Clean Git History

- Use meaningful commit messages
- Follow commit message conventions
- Avoid fixup commits (get it right the first time)
- Use atomic commits (one logical change per commit)

** Communication

- Document all assumptions in sprint backlog
- Add questions when uncertain
- Explain "why" not just "what" in commits
- Make PR descriptions comprehensive

** Time Management

- Keep tasks small and manageable
- Don't let perfect be the enemy of good
- Make progress, document issues, move forward
- Use BLOCKED status appropriately
