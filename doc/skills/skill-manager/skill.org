* When to use this skill

When the user requests the creation of a new skill or updating of an existing
skill.

* How to use this skill

1. *Identify the skill* from the request. If it's not clear, request more
   information from the user.
2. Check the skill library to see if any skills exist that match the request. If
   not create a new skill.
3. Follow the rules under Detailed instructions to manage the request.

* Detailed instructions

The next sections contain a set of detailed instructions that must be followed
when handling requests for the creation of new skills or updating existing
skills.

** ORE Studio skill setup

- All claude code skill templates are stored under =doc/skills= as org-mode
  documents.
- These then generate actual skills under =.claude/skills= via CMake targets. DO
  NOT EVER modify =.claude/skills= directly as your changes will be overwritten.

** Creating new skills

To create a new skill:

- Agree the skill name with the user. Help the user come up with a concise name
  for the skill, which does not overlap with existing skills.
- Create a new folder under =doc/skills/SKILL-NAME=, replacing =SKILL-NAME= with
  the actual skill name. Folders should be all in lower case with dashes
  separating words. Example =my-new-skil=.
- Create a new file inside the new folder called =skill.org=. The file must
  have the following structure:

  - Preamble:

#+begin_src fundamental

:ID: GUID
:END:
#+title: TITLE
#+author: Marco Craveiro
#+options: <:nil c:nil todo:nil ^:nil d:nil date:nil author:nil toc:nil

     Updating the following fields:
        - =GUID=: use =uuid= tool to generate a new UUID.
        - =TITLE=: title for the new skill, short and descriptive, properly
          capitalised.
        - =SKILL-NAME=: must match the folder used by the new skill.
        - =SKILL DESCRIPTION=: short one line skill description.

  - Body:
    - Add a section called "When to use this skill". It should identify the use
      cases for the skill. It should be a short paragraph.
    - Add a section called "How to use this skill". It should be composed of a
      set of concise steps on how to use the skill. If the skill requires more
      than 2 or 3 steps, point the reader to a section called "Detailed
      instructions".
    - If necessary add a section called "Detailed instructions" with step by
      step description of the skill.

  - Postamble:
    - Add the following:

    - Update the file =doc/skills/claude_code_skills.org= in section "Available
      Skills" with a link to new skill, following the pattern of the previous
      skills.

** Updating existing skills

To update an existing skill:

- Locate the skill under =doc/skills=
- Update the org-mode file in the desired location.
- Inform the user the update has been performed and that skills need to be
  regenerated.
