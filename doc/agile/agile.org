Agile and, more generally, on our ideas around software engineering, the
following essays may be of interest (in no particular order).

* Backlogs

All agile related information is kept in /Backlogs/. There are two types of
backlogs:

- [[id:558650A4-C3E5-8964-4193-7D9125E29B83][Product Backlog]]: Contains all of the captured stories that have not yet been
  assigned to a sprint.
- [[id:57A7FABC-21FE-5124-45EB-9685D0712176][Sprint Backlog]]: Either archives of stories we have worked on or the stories we
  are currently working on.
