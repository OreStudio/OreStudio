Assorted documentation about the domain of finance. These are notes I have
collected over the years and are of some relevance to this application.
Initially, this will be more of a documentation dump but hopefully we'll
organise this content in a meaningful manner over time.

Topics:

- [[id:8BF323A0-B868-7AA4-EC7B-D988934482AA][Computational Finance]]: Introduction to the field and scoping of the ambitions
  of the present effort.
- [[id:9EB4715F-5A5D-4F14-0CAB-A4208240A813][Money and its Close Relatives]]: Fundamental concepts related to money.
